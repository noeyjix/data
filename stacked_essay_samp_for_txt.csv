"Since the inception of human civilization, we have pursued happiness. In order to achieve happiness, people started a race against nature which ignited for economic opulence and industrial revolution; resulting into a dramatic episodes of climate change: a global phenomenon which resulted in physical local impacts. These impacts are most prominent in developing countries like Nepal which has a miniature influence. The vulnerability has affected the sustainability of rural people by abating societal, economic and environmental module. One of the effects of climate change is cloud bursting and subsequent flooding as hydrological and meteorological flux. Uttarakhand Flash flood 2013 was one of the major climate change impacts in South Asia which claimed thousands of lives including both my parents. Because of personal tragedy, I thought deeply about the causes of this phenomena. Later it was revealed to be the result of a lack of proper dissemination of information. This tragedy disintegrated our social structure. I felt like I was an edifice without foundation. But I later became like a plane which flew through a turbulent storm and now I have learnt to pass through it safely. Although I lost my parents, I have turned my pains into strength which flourished and motivated me to have an unwavering passion for learning about climate change. I started my journey to Mustang with a passion to travelling and community service, but I wrapped by facing serious impacts of climate change. Here, the eroded rocks from the surrounding mountains had carpeted the floor and the high noon sun was mercilessly falling on the road. I was reeled up with the heat waves from the upper Himalayan belt with no hint of shade. Along the way I could see the narrowed Kali-Gandaki River, dried stone water taps and other water sources, which has been twirling the situation into acute water crisis; dwindling agricultural productivity. A local alluded that since snowfall gradually lessened and no rainfall occurred the last year, the problem of water scarcity escalated. Due to low levels of snowfall and high temperature, the snow leopards in the upper region have started to perish; a major environmental catastrophe. The next day I approached locals to hear their stories. 70-year-old Ramkaji Dolkar said that the effects on livestock and agriculture are indeed frightening, but the effects on the human seem to be scarier. It was difficult to find pasture land for grazing mountain goats and cows. Those who made livelihood by grazing cattle are now experiencing serious challenges. Also, due to lack of productivity, inflation has occurred making the local's lives difficult to make two meals of bread and butter a day. On the other side, people are losing their assets and food resources, they are heading rapidly toward famine which is causing a wave of illnesses and panic in the population there. Today it is mandatory to seek transformation for the climate change impacts. A tangible intervention in capitalizing pilot projects and replicating them in beneficiaries may enable capacity building or local communities and stake holders. This would build a sense of ethical responsibility in an entire community to take actions against climate change and reduce its impacts. An innovative measure that reflects practical approach for sustainability is urgent today. Climate change is hard and difficult however it is not impossible. In a country like Nepal where the daily earning is only $9.95, the effect seems to be more sensitive in upcoming days. It will cause the lives of the locals more suffering if no measures were taken at the right time. Through the premier eminence of extensive pragmatic and scientific education, I would like to focus on extemporized and tactical approaches to mitigate the effects of climate change. Unforeseen tragedies in my life and my analysis has inspired and encouraged me to study the field of climate change. All these aspirations have an unconditional support for shaping my dreams."
"""To Kill a Mockingbird"", a book by Harper Lee questions the stereotypes of the society and prevailing racism which has motivated me enough to probe the existing terms and conditions created by the society that mislead to such stereotypes that produce a number of mockingbirds. This book has encouraged me to create an impact on this society by respecting the innocence and existing goodwill through literacy and awareness. It has set a sheer epitome of the society's variety; that brings with itself call of many mockingbirds whose goodness and self potency have been badly defeated by the ignorance, hailing poverty and typecasts. It motivated me to take risks, fight for justice, create a positive impact on other people's life and choose for the best even if it would mean to go against stereotypical society and terms so that I as an individual can always hope for the best."
"Life is not just a period, it's a sequence of growth, betterments and adjustments. One such factor that exercises the human brain and brings the best out of an individual's trials to changes is learning. It might not promise perfections but it promises fight and win-over fight against the odds of yesterday's life. The difficulties of today could be answered by the processes of learning because it pacifies mind, doodles imaginations, creates and solves curiosities and mysteries, makes realize what's better for me as an individual. Flourishing in hopes and imaginations, dreams and faiths; that are the incentives soar to heights of possibilities. I am always a voracious learner from the real life events. Through my parent's untimely demise, I learnt to foster competence, and creativity to enter the larger world with socially responsible goals. The lessons I have learned to fight with troubles and those nightmare experiences I had."
"I will never forget the heaviness I felt Tuesday morning, April 15, 2014. As I readied myself for the day, my school's matron, Aunty B as we called her, walked solemnly into the dormitory, announcing that over 200 girls from the northern Nigerian town of Chibok had been kidnapped by the terrorist organization, Boko Haram. The news shook me as I realized that the girls were kidnapped for wanting an education, which I am still privileged to pursue. Two years later, the majority of the girls are still missing, and Boko Haram continues its unbridled attacks on villages, leaving thousands of Nigerians displaced. In addition to interfering with the educations of young people, these incessant attacks have resulted in communities devoid of basic health and living amenities. Growing up in Nigeria, I have read about the many initiatives of the government to improve the lives of its citizens. However, many government officials, lacking the integrity and competence to execute these plans, instead squander funds designated to address these problems. Thus, without systematic resolutions in sight, listening to the many challenges facing my fellow Nigerian citizens, especially young girls, has been discouraging. Nevertheless, I find it more disheartening to remain sedentary and nonchalant to such blatant denials of fundamental needs of the people of Nigeria. Therefore, in my own little way, I resolved to address some of the problems Nigerian communities face. In my junior year, I contacted Kingdom Kids Club, an organization that I had volunteered with several times before. I knew they housed and educated many displaced children from villages under siege, so I decided to support them by raising awareness about their efforts as well as the resources they still needed. For instance, taking to my school newspaper, and my website, chibokgirls.org, I wrote about the children in the organization, who appreciated the current education offered by Kingdom Kids, but still lacked books for certain subjects. When my research made headlines in the Nigerian newspaper, Vanguard, I knew I had succeeded in creating awareness. However, my job was not finished. Driven by my belief that education is a basic human right, I also delivered textbooks to Kingdom Kids for subjects lacking them. Currently, during my gap year, I have had more time to research the plight of girls displaced by violence and terrorism. Researching displaced camps encouraged me to help young girls in the slums of inner city Lagos, where necessities like healthcare and hygiene are lacking. Successfully soliciting donations from local schools and organizations to purchase basic amenities, I delivered items, such as, sanitary towels, classroom materials, and food, to slums with the help of friends and family and after a harrowing canoe ride across swampy waters. Reflecting on conversations I had with girls in the slums, I am inspired by their resilience and desire to succeed despite their difficult situations. Learning from these girls, I strive to be tenacious in my efforts to empower disadvantaged Nigerian citizens through my new website totalgirl.org. I now channel my frustrations in the Nigerian government's failure to assist the downtrodden into tangible actions, no matter how small. Most importantly, through the support of family, friends, and other organizations in the work I do, I have come to realize that as the popular adage goes ""it takes a village to raise a child,"" thus suggesting that I do not have to resolve Nigeria's problems alone. I choose to take part in the solution, encouraging others to play a role as well, hopeful that our efforts impact lives positively."
"My favorite film is 'The Lion King.' I find its message, facing one's past and overcoming challenges significant. Simba's decision to return to Pride Rock after running from his past is pivotal because he overthrows his evil uncle and takes his rightful seat as King. I emphathize with Simba running to an easier present as I reflect on my battle with my self-image and snide remarks made about my weight. It was easier at first to ignore the comments and avoid confrontation with damaging state of my self-esteem. I soon realized that I failed to assert myself through responses that illustrated that I was more than numbers on a scale. Like Simba, I now choose to face my past, endeavoring to improve my self-esteem. I understand the importance of facing these difficulties and have learned valuable lessons along the way- lessons that are all part of the circle of life."
"An ideal college environment for me is one that readily gives back to different communities, and zealously seeks to remedy injustices. As an individual dedicated to tearing down educational and health barriers for young girls in my country, Nigeria, I hope to further develop my website, and in the near future, be able to more effectively and successfully address more of Nigeria's issues. I also value a socially conscientious environment and focus on inclusive communities. Moving from Nigeria to school in New York, I know first-hand how difficult the transition can be. Although I enjoyed my school, I did not always feel that there was a space to discuss culture shocks and social discomforts that followed the reality of moving to a different country. In the aforementioned environment I hope to be involved in spaces for discussion, addressing initial discomforts, and the exchange of new ideas."
"EIGHT PEOPLE PER DAY. The bewildering fact of how eight Mongolians die every day due to liver related medical conditions shocked me. Practically someone in every family in Mongolia is prone to these illnesses, especially liver cancer. My curiosity led me to Dr. Naranbaatar Dashdorj, the co-founder of Onom Foundation (OF), an institution that aims to reduce liver illness casualties. In August 2015, I started my first project as an intern at OF, helping save 25-year-old Ariunjargal's life. Ariunjargal shad hepatitis B and D super-infection, the most severe form of hepatitis in humans. Due to the severity of his condition, Ariunjargal needed an urgent liver transplant, but was unable to pay the 85 million Mongolian tugriks (approximately 40 thousand USD) required for the operation. To help his situation, I, with the help of my coworkers, set up the ""Healthy Liver Fund"" campaign. Within the Healthy Liver Fund I established the #NaizChallenge (#FriendChallenge) in which people each nominated three of their friends to donate as much as they could and those three would nominate three other friends and so on. This campaign was launched on TV with about ten news agencies reporting. Furthermore, we held a concert with renowned Mongolian artists who were happy to help me with the project. Through these activities we raised 40 million tugriks, nearly half of the full treatment cost. I then convened with my high school's Interact Club (where I was the Head Boy, Prefect and Interact Club Director) about the campaign and was able to add one million tugriks to the Fund by organizing bake sales, mufti-days and charity sports events. Through these activities I supervised, my OF team succeeded in raising sufficient amount of money for the transplant and Ariunjargal got a successful liver transplant at the beginning of October 2015. Unfortunately, this is just one case among thousands. All of them are people Mongolia's future desperately needs and I aim to contribute my part as a citizen to help further reduce the casualties. The Hepatitis endemic and its consequent liver diseases in Mongolia are out of hand. It is impossible to raise donations for every single person who cannot afford treatments. I believed it would be ideal to set up a global motion to suppress the casualties and seek solutions. Coincidentally, Onom Foundation organized a first-time global workshop in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia with scientists from many organizations and institutions including some from Stanford, Harvard and Johns Hopkins, several others from the WHO, NIH and CDC. During the workshop, I took every opportunity to speak to the guests over lunch and during breaks. This experience enabled me to create connections with excellent minds from all around the globe that motivated me more than ever to help others in need, and made me realize what I would need to accomplish my goals - a strong higher education. Hepatitis killed 1.5 million people globally in 2013. That is more than TB, malaria and HIV. Yet it is widely ignored. Through the workshop and other activities, I have come to realize that it will take people from a wide range of disciplines, from policymakers to scientists, to bring hepatitis to the spotlight. I aspire to use my current and future social connections, knowledge, and education to help save lives of thousands of Mongolians dying of liver cancer. I believe that making a difference in Mongolia, the ground zero of viral hepatitis endemic, will help to raise awareness of hepatitis globally and save millions of lives around the globe."
"The mere idea of striving for progress and gaining invaluable education from college quickens my heartbeats. Learning more and more everyday is an essential part of my life. I read, watch and listen to many news outlets. However, none of them compare to the education and information that college may offer. Sitting in lectures, attending seminars and waking up every morning to gain another step towards my ultimate goal with more progress every single day. That is what I look forward to most in college. Failures and hard times will rise, but beating them each time they darken my path to academic and career achievements is what will be on my mind."
"My all time favorite book is the whole Harry Potter series. To many and most, the series tells of a boy who was destined for greatness since birth and his adventures. In my case, the books exhibit the story of a woman who has had a rough start to her adulthood overcoming life's difficulties and eventually becoming one of the most influential persons in her field. Of course, I write of the renowned J.K. Rowling. I believe that she and I share a similar path to an eventual success despite the financially weak conditions overshadowing the majority of our young adulthood. It is my utmost ambition to, one day, be a highly influential person whose commitment post-success is to help those in need and become a philanthropist."
"An insurmountable amount of pain filled my entire body, as I laid on the concrete paralyzed with fear and humiliation. The cackles, shouts, and obscenities were distorted by the sound of a blow to my face then a kick to my abdomen then my rib cage with punches raining down simultaneously. I fought back relentlessly until my body stiffened and blood stained the hot concrete. I thought this would be the end, but it was only the beginning. Helicopter blades beating the air into submission, gunshots firing, and sirens roaring were my lullabies and the ghetto my cradle that swayed me back and forth in its vicious cycle, but for many, these were murder ballads that abruptly shattered their reality. In spite of the violence witnessed, we, at some point, are subjected to abide by communal norms even if they are maladaptive and further exacerbate systemic issues. Equally, we are also the offspring of the place we were cultivated. It comes with maturity, understanding, and facing the certainty of our current state, where we are confronted with the decision to stagnate or to grow. Deprived, degraded, and disenfranchised as I looked around the poorly kept over capacitated classrooms filled with outdated, ragged textbooks and unruly inner-city students. Where dropping out was commonplace, and enthusiasm in the classroom was seldom. As I continued in a monotonous, seemingly inescapable environment, I was desperate for a change in scenery. I wanted to be in an environment conducive to my success. An environment with like-minded individuals with a desire to learn. Shedding all I have known, I made the decision to uproot from the school that was limiting my potential. With my eyes set high, I decided my sophomore year to attend a magnet school with a strong, diverse curriculum that would encourage and foster learning. After the transfer, I began to ascend academically. I no longer felt deprived and was stimulated through thought-provoking discussions coupled with rigorous assignments. Later that school year, I was admitted into the Academy of Medical Sciences which was highly competitive and selective program that only admitted 25 students. I finally found the ideal environment that would allow me to explore different disciplines. In spite of the change in schools, I did not completely eradicate the remnants of my neighborhood and those I befriended in them. I thought the ends justifies the means. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. I think, therefore I am. I then thought that I would not become a product of my environment and would defy stigmas. I soon became pregnant. Fear, dismay, and dejection all descended upon me like smog. Overwhelmed with emotions, I decided to continue with the pregnancy. Regrettably, at 12 weeks I delivered my stillborn son, and a large portion of me died with my son. I became diagnosed with severe depression and was on a negative trend. My fall from grace was difficult to understand and was a lonesome period in my life. I was unable to mourn but found inspiration in my misfortune to absolve responsibility and become the architect of my future. The following school year, I challenged myself to fulfill my potential and recover academically. I took advantage of every opportunity that presented itself. The following summer of my senior year, I began working with Breakthrough Miami as a teaching fellow with at-risk minority youth. The experience was life altering; I found a purpose through my students. Many of my students mirrored my younger self, and I was able to make a lifelong impact. I decided to take on a gap year and commit myself to a service year with Breakthrough Miami. This human experience has birthed an enlightened version of me that has become an advocate for at-risk students and lower socioeconomic communities. Because of this meaningful work, I chose growth which justified my means."
"""Through the windshield, I saw the rain coming down in sheets"" As I read the last sentence, I was struck with unbearable, yet well-warranted emotion. I thought to myself, my tears, perhaps where tears that I had been suppressing inside my ""strong black woman"" bravado for some time. These tears, came down in their sheets, as thoughts of my life, still having to face the atrocities of a world I had no part in building but would be expected to repair, came to life. I wept because Coates' narrated not only his story but my story as well, Coates was able to articulate these sentiments when I had no way of expressing such thoughts. Coates' experiences mirrored my own from accepting my unexpected role as an educator with low-income, minority youth in the restless and ruthless inner cities of Miami, to my exploration and rebirth, producing who I am today."
"Learning The love of learning has been a part of me for as long as I can remember. My inquisitive nature and hunger to learn more and know more is a pillar to the foundation of my identity. Reading anything in print, listening to the pronunciation and articulation of words of any television show in search of the perfect ""American"" accent, I was ravenous in my pursuit of mastering the English language when I first began to assimilate American culture. I fondly recall the experience of learning new pieces of information that piqued my interests in school. Filled with curiosity, I bombarded my teachers with questions day after day after spending countless nights bruising hyperlinks-turning blue into that distinct shade of purple. As I ascended the ranks expecting to hunger to be fulfilled, paradoxically I felt starved. In search of something to satiate my hunger, I found Emory."
"I'm too much. People place limits on my characteristics - they say I'm ""too smart"", ""too opinionated"", ""too outspoken"" - every other remark I hear is juxtaposed neatly with this limiting word, ""too"". It's understandable; my English class debates are filled with passion and force, my wild hand gestures give company to my animated facial expressions, and my laughter when I'm with my friends can often be heard at the other end of the hall. Almost every person I've known, whether it be a peer, a teacher, even a relative, will chuckle and pose the question: ""Have you always been like this?"" The answer is no. Since childhood, I knew only one way of interacting with others - keeping quiet. I made it a point to hide everything about myself that might make me the slightest bit conspicuous. I took care not to speak my language, Hindi, in front of my classmates, as if letting them hear would instantly expose all of my insecurities. I kept my lunch box, filled with various ""embarrassing"" Indian items, on my lap, discreetly reaching in when no-one was looking. Something as simple as telling a peer my name gave me anxiety. I've written my name on countless papers. Math homework, tourist visa applications - the list goes on. I've always wished, however, that I wouldn't have to write anything at all. My name is Viraj Singh Attre, and it's always been a point of anxiousness for me. My parents say my name is beautiful, but I don't think it's pretty to pontificate the proper pronunciation anytime I meet someone. Nevertheless, whenever teachers said the anthem, ""Vye-rah.Veee-Ragh..Virjah,"" I raised my hand meekly. For fear, anger, and exasperation, I never bothered to correct everyone who uttered the ugly mispronunciation. This continued until one of my friends asked, ""What does your name mean, anyways?"" I found myself at a loss for words. I stared blankly for a few seconds, before replying quietly, ""I don't know."" It was when they laughed that I hid behind my hands, silently resolving to find out once and for all why my name's meaning was that important. And I did. I went back to school the next year with the same name, the same string of disappointment. This time, though, I corrected the teachers. ""It's actually pronounced ""Vir-aj"", not Rodger. Not at all actually."" I spoke with my parents in my language as they walked up to my friends and me to pick me up from school. ""Yes, I speak this language at home - 'Hindi'."" I plopped my lunch box on the table and proudly displayed my Indian lunch each day. ""It's called paratha, want to try some?"" In doing all of these things, I was giving myself an identity, showing everyone, and most importantly, myself, that I was brave enough to fight for who I am and what I believe in. I am too much, and I'm proud of it. I am ""too vocal"", and ""too argumentative"" and ""too Indian"". I could have easily continued to conceal my food under the lunch table and pretended I didn't speak another language in front of my friends. It would be easy enough to let people think my name was pronounced like a Mayan temple. But doing that would be doing injustice not only to my name, but to myself and to my culture. It would be accepting defeat and accepting all of the ""too""s that make me the person I am as limits. Doing that would mean limiting myself to a shy, quiet disposition, limiting myself to a life of hiding my true character. But I'm doing quite the opposite. Viraj is limitless."
"I think a significant challenge is the question of how will we live our lives in 50 years. I've had the great fortune to develop legislation of autonomous cars, and to help run a start-up that's using A.I. to replace some functions of doctors in diagnosing breast cancer. In that sense, I've been exposed to a lot of automation, but on the other hand, I've worked for a labor union of skilled carpenters to lobby against changing labor and trade laws, and many of my friends from high school are going on to work in unskilled labor fields. So in having these disparate experiences, I can recognize the severity of this challenge - my autonomous car policy was expected to put forty-million truck drivers out of a job in the next twenty years. What are we going to do all day? I hope for the best, but fear the worst."
"This really feeds back into my first response. There are these grand changes coming, in addition to the great changes that have come recently. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like a lot of decisions that affect a lot of people are considered with the gravitas the situation demands. In my study of Operations Research, I've accepted an implicit burden, of using my ability to identify organizational patterns and improve systems efficiency for good. My mentor, Alvin Roth, won a Nobel Prize specifically for applying economic theory to getting dying people kidneys and connecting the right students to the right colleges. So I have this tremendous power, and with it, a responsibility to do good. While I'm proud of what I've accomplish so far, there's still more to do, and to do it, I need to push the limits, push myself, to do more with it, which motivates me to learn more."
"The bifocal lens is arguably one of the most ingenious scientific-inventions of the 19th century. My awe for bifocals comes from experience - they give me proper sight. In today's world, such advancement seems like a trivial thing, but there lies a profound philosophy behind those lenses - they have an ability to find intersection in difference, to find convergence in divergence. As I ventured into my gap-year, I adopted this philosophy of intersecting two varied interests into one unified journey. I've always been someone who longs for academic opportunities that are in line with my intellectual thirst. I began a research project at the Indian Institute of Technology, which was a study of the 'management of basic-education in rural India'. In collaboration with professional researchers, I helped analyse social-trends and explored the implications of local policies regarding the reach and quality of basic-education in rural India. We utilised a dual approach of employing quantitative mathematical models to track data, then using qualitative reasoning to interpret that data. Eventually, there came a pivotal moment when we ventured into the field with an objective of procuring additional data. I had the opportunity to interact and converse with many villagers. Far from the commotion of the city, I realised education was a colossal problem. Though municipal schools existed, they lacked teachers, had poor infrastructure, and lacked proper textbooks and learning material. A majority of the parents understood the importance of education and its ability to get rid of poverty, but we could see how the lack of quality educational institutions discouraged further involvement of students. As a result, I saw children who were engaged in child labor trying to support the finances of the family. Our study showed this never-ending cycle of poverty and victimized life. I gained an unforgiving exposure to the harsh realities of their world. I look back at this experience as giving me clarity of purpose. I've always believed in the power of social-entrepreneurship and its ability to translate knowledge into action. The Village Empowerment Program, an initiative I began in high school, was originally aimed at adopting a village near Chennai and improving its infrastructural facilities. But with a redefined purpose, I assembled a team of talented peers, collaborated with a local rotary club and established a small-scale school in the village to provide basic education to its children. We assembled volunteers, devised a teaching plan and began conducting classes on social studies, basic science, mathematics, sanitation, and general awareness. Reaching out to my young learners was a challenging task, but I taught them that in order to learn, one just has to ask. Soon enough, I kindled their curiosity and what followed was a galore of questions. Their insatiable curiosity and uninhibited questioning reminded me of the true essence of learning. As months passed, I noticed a bonding occurring between us. The entire team would spend time playing games with these children. We would share lunches together, discussing the contrasts between life in the city and life in the village. We even accompanied these children to their homes and observed how they live. These students taught me something in return - deriving joy from the small things in life. They taught me humility. Over the last few months, as I engaged myself in a learning-experience quite unconventional from what school had typically been for me, I gained a sense of self. My experience augmented my understanding of the world around me and opened my eyes to a severe problem in my community. My civic-engagement project empowered me to solve this problem in my own way. Like the bifocals, these two varied experiences culminated in molding my dream: to establish an educational institution, however humble its beginnings, which will redefine learning for that village and grow to be a more stimulating school that encourages a child's curiosity and gives total freedom for them to explore and grow."
"""Don't forget your questions!"" Mumma would shout before I leave for school. Whether it's my constant desire to explore new academic-domains or to learn new skills while imparting my own, I am always on the search for an intellectual-challenge. From taking the 'Social Enterprise and Impact Investing' course, to exploring Linguistic-Sciences during shopping-period, it's Emory's academic-freedom that makes it my mind's ideal playground. By taking classes across schools, I hope to build interdisciplinary-bonds and mould myself into a creative Thinker, Economist, Philosopher, Artist and Scientist. My pursuit of a holistic-education at Emory will push me outside my comfort-zone, make me question old-paradigms, enable me to explore new disciplines and encourage my curiosity. As I enter the portals of Emory and identify myself as an 'Emory Eagle', I know I'll make Mumma proud, because what better place to ask questions than the place that will give me the most interesting answers."
"The Afghan Girl-a mesmerizing portrait of a girl looking over her right shoulder; her eyes glisten. Aside from a few holes in the burka canopying her hair, there is no indication of her identity. Ultimately, it's the eyes that confront and hypnotize you. A piercing glare, both breathtakingly-beautiful yet heartbreakingly-haunting. Her scrutiny, combined with her aura of youthful innocence yet inner-strength, works together to create an image of resilience. She had seen more violence and deprivation in her thirteen years of life than most people will in their lifetimes, fortunately. For me, this intense National Geographic photograph shares Afghanistan's story to the world: twenty-three years of war, 1.5 million killed, 3.5 million refugees. This is the consequence of war. This photograph impressed upon me a deep defiance towards the act of war and the need for today's governments to be more progressive and to build peaceful solutions for global problems."
"Persian New Year, or Nowruz, is a time of celebration and love. A lavish tradition to welcome spring. My earliest Nowruz: A mirror sat at the head of the dining table, flanked by white pillar candles on silver stands. A plate of wheat sprouts among dishes of Russian olives, powdered sumac, garlic, sweetened wheat paste, colored apples, and vinegar in Isfahan vases. A bowl of emptied, painted eggs sat in front of a bigger bowl of goldfish that graced through crystalline water. Flowers towered above it all. Daisies, roses, tulips, hyacinth. They decorated the home with the earthy redolence of spring. Everything lay over a deep red tablecloth, embroidered with gold and sapphire paisleys and sequins. My mother handed me a book of Hafiz. She directed me to place it on the table, closed and in the center, as tradition dictated. I looked down at Hafiz's portrait on the book. He stared back. I fumbled, and nearly dropped the book into the fishbowl before positioning the text. My mother side-eyed me. I turned away to spare myself the sense of inadequacy in the face of a culture thousands of years old. I have always been proud of my Iranian heritage. I speak Farsi, dance to Iranian melodies with curled hands and soft steps; my heartbeat matches that of an Iranian drum. I strive to exemplify honesty, humility, and passion in all that I do. A reflection of the scholars of old. It is not only to become self-aware, but to be educated, refined, composed. But I do not believe I am truly Iranian. My parents are a different strain, from a separate generation. I am an offshoot. I cannot speak as my great-grandmother did whilst reciting the ghazals of Hafiz. My words stumble. My tongue struggles. My mind switches between Farsi and English. I am a hybrid of the new and old, who was once lost in a sea of American ideals and Iranian expectations. I am at peace with this, because being strictly Iranian or American would be insufficient. I cannot speak like my great-grandmother. She was a child bride. I am not. I cannot grasp archaic ideals, because my world cannot endure narrow-minded values. It craves conscientious thought and heart. Hafez watches. But I know that with my thirst for knowledge and a fierce passion to achieve, where I belong is here-I know myself, and am proud of my identity. I am not the goldfish on the Nowruz table. I am not constricted by glass. I am not floating through the water that is life. I am the scent of hyacinth that waltzed through the home that Nowruz night, spilling out onto the street and into the world, the very place I intend to establish myself in the future. I will accomplish this, with the heart and conscientious thought that always sought to create a space in which I can dance with soft steps and continue to lose myself between the pages of knowledge."
"In my future college experience, I am most looking forwards to research. I got my first taste of research working with iCARE, a patient-orientated organization that looks for and provides alternative forms of treatment for cancer patients. Similar research opportunities will enable me to tap into my passions and put them to work. It is enough to know I'm helping another life, regardless of the size of the impact, because doing the research itself is what excites me most. Research can go a long way. It doesn't have to be something monumental, or something bound to forever change society. Engaging in college research will not only prepare me for the medical field I'm willing to wade through. Research will let my curiosity run free and put it to good use. Research will prove my dedication to my future career in medicine. And I'm just plain excited to begin my work."
"I can explain why the body falls into a fever when under attack by a foreign agent, and why the Vikings were so adept at raiding medieval Europe. When I learn, I'm motivated by the push to always be knowledgeable, however little I know, because I can be built on it. I simply love to learn because I know that with the knowledge I can accumulate, I can be conscious and perceptive about everything else I learn, and by the small intricacies of the world around me. The body goes into a fever because cells work faster at higher temperatures to get rid of the invading bacteria or virus. The Vikings were master raiders because their deep- and shallow-water longboats allowed them to travel through European rivers. I learn to piece together all the knowledge I can, and because there is always something left to learn for my insatiable curiosity."
"Voice of the Voiceless Imprisoned inside his own body, he lay motionless. He was consciously voiceless and paralyzed. About a year ago, he had graduated from being a patient whose prognosis was uncertain to an official quadriplegic after an unfortunate road accident. Since then he had been living his life ""locked-in"" and the only thing that he could voluntarily control was blinking his eyelids. He could breathe, but not without the help of a respirator. He could eat, but not without a gastric pipe. My grandfather's brother was rendered paralytic after a road accident. After meeting him and seeing his condition, I was sleepless for nights. How could a man live a life which made him dependent on others for his most basic tasks. Moreover, he did not have the ability to express himself. The only medium of expression he had was his ability to blink his eyes. This blinking could only be understood by close ones. Hence he was severely disabled when it came to communication. He had lost one of the basic human rights, the right of speech and expression. During one of those sleepless nights, it struck me that if somehow technology could be used to read, comprehend and translate the blinking of his eyes, he could once again start communicating with humans normally. I researched and found out that quadriplegics, people suffering from ALS and others who have been ""locked-in"" most often retain the ability to voluntarily blink eyes. Hence I decided to research on possible ways of such limited human computer interaction. By sheer coincidence, I had been working on a computer vision algorithm that could detect the state of an object in a digital image. It occurred to me if this algorithm could be adapted to read the state of his eyes, a computer system could be designed that would read his eye blinks. Furthermore, speech synthesis technology could be incorporated in this system and a complete solution could be developed that would allow a locked-in person to speak. As I lay sleepless, the practical details of this implementation of my algorithm for this specific purpose unfolded in my quietly fascinated mind. Along with these thoughts was the feeling of optimism. I had an opportunity to further my objective of serving humanity through technology. After working tirelessly on this concept for about a week, I had made an embedded computer system that could help a paralytic person type on a computer with just the blink of his eyes. The hardware that I had developed for this purpose was by no means a thing of beauty, with a wire sticking out from here and another from there. However, this proof of concept worked like magic. I had successfully developed a technological solution to the problem. Today, my grandfather's brother uses this home brewed solution to communicate with the rest of world. I was thrilled to know the vast possible applications of this algorithm. The algorithm could be used with limited resources, since I had designed it with intent of running it on modest hardware. It could also be used on a mobile computer like a smart-phone. I believe that a smart-phone application, that utilizes the camera of the phone and further incorporate the use of artificial intelligence to predict and suggests words as a person types, would simplify lives for many other people who have been ""locked-in"". I believe that these improvements will really decrease the time taken for typing in the input by blinking the eyes. As I recall my first meet with my grandfather's brother, I want to thank him for inspiring me. Without him I would have never recognized the hidden potential within my creation. After this episode, my goal of serving humanity through technology has matured into a specific strategy. The uphill journey towards my objective has its own 'eureka' moments. These moments induce motivation in me and keeps me going."
"Albert Einstein once said""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."" If a nuclear war does happen, all sentient beings on earth will perish and the few who will survive will have to adopt to harsh environment. Maintaining world peace not letting small conflict escalate into full scale nuclear world war is the most important challenge. It is often seen that discrimination and oppression often leads to conflict and war. Hence, the biggest challenge is to build an inclusive society that does not discriminate between people. The only way the civilization will progress is by removing any and all barriers that divide humanity and accepting our brethren without any discrimination. If we do not take a step towards it and preach nationalism instead of globalism, a third world war and destruction of earth is imminent."
"Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill is my favorite non-fiction work. This book preaches about the power of motivation and visualization and gives a peek inside the mind and thought process of great people of the nineteenth and twentieth century, like Thomas A. Edison, Henry Ford and Woodrow Wilson This book provides you with thirteen rules of success. The book is filled with short stories about people who took courageous decision and worked hard to make those decisions the right one. Every story told with in this book is shouting to the reader to hear and see what is readily available to all who seek it and makes him believe that if he want something bad enough and you visualize it enough he will get it. With each read, the meanings of Napoleon Hill's words grow deeper with meaning within the readers subconscious."
"Ever since I was in the fifth grade, I thought that I had my life completely planned out. As it turns out, my plans fell short of my expectations. I just knew that I was going to go to high school and complete it with the optimal grades possible, go to college right after high school, and subsequently become a pediatrician. Two of those goals have not been completed to my standards. First, I did not graduate high school with at least a 3.3 for the fourth quarter, and I did not go to college the summer after graduation. I tend to get distressed when I do not complete deadlines or achieve the goals that I set for myself. Because some of my essential goals were not accomplished, I truly considered myself a disappointment. When one spends all or most of there life planning and being confident with the idea that their future will have no obstacles, it hurts when those goals are not completed. I ended high with an approximate 3.6 grade point average. That is a good GPA for the classes that I took my senior year, but that is the lowest that I have ever had. My senior year was the worst for me. As the year kept going on, I kept feeling that I was hurting my family and especially myself because I was not persevering hard enough. I started to give into my failure. Instead of settling down and figuring out a way to come on top, I kept doing the same things. I really broke down on the inside because I hate to not achieve my goals. Nevertheless, by the end of my senior year, I regained my confidence and started to believe in my future decisions. With the help of some very great people, I decided to take a year off. Even though I never saw this happening in my life, I knew it was the right decision. It has and is becoming clear to me that it is okay to take ""the road less traveled."" The path of someone else is not always the right path for everyone. I have now taken pride in using this year to my benefit. I will apply early to some of the best colleges, and I will focus on many scholarships. The struggles of my senior year have pushed me to make this year the most influential. What I once considered failing was actually the jumpstart to a productive and inspiring year. I can honestly say that I made the best decision. I know that by the end of May 2017 my life will be on the track that I knew it would be all along"
"Ever since I was a little girl, I have wanted to become a Pediatrician. The determination for my future keeps me going every day. It takes many people numerous years to finally know what they truly want to be. That has never really been the case for me. Because I know the potential struggles that will come with me aiming to be a doctor, I have always made sure that I work my hardest in everything that I do. Furthermore, my family also motivates me to learn. Both my mother and my grandmother were nurses. Everything I do is to make them proud. They are the main people that have been supporting my dreams since the very beginning. I persevere through the hard times because I know that when I walk across that stage, they will be right there cheering me on."
"I cannot wait to truly experience college life. I have ALWAYS wanted to be on campus, stay in a dorm, and make new friends. By staying on campus, I will have the oppurtunity find a new independence that I am yet to experience. I have always lived with my mom. When I start college, it will be time to grow up and do things on my own. As unusual as this might sound, I cant wiat to be a full time student amd be stessed with homework. I cant wait to be challenged and pushed to my full potential. I am willing to let college build a Bryana that no one has seen yet. Finally, I am beyond ready to open the doors to new relationships. I have always been one to make friends, but I cant wait to meet older more mature peers."
"Growing up in Pakistan, I was taught to hate gays; even the word gay is looked upon as immoral and unethical. In some strata of the society, it is used to abuse somebody. Being gay in such a society leaves no friends and supporters in the family, and it is out of question to have someone favoring you and listening to your feelings at all. In a society as intolerant, people with such sexual orientations do not mix with 'normal' people. Being friends with gays can ruin one's reputation as outcast. Does this sound familiar? Not in the West, right? But it is in Pakistan. Feeling vary of them; I had no idea that the canvas I had painted with caution would come crashing back down on me. It all happened when my grandmother remarked condescendingly about the skin tone of my newborn nephew: ""Oh he is a negro like his uncle (me)"". It felt as if a saw crushed my strong self-image into a thousand pieces and rendered me worthless. I encountered Zia in my new school, a very sweet person who happened to be gay. I heard hundreds of hurtful comments on him: 'this guy is a freak' and 'he is queer, stay away from him'. The memory of being called a negro flashed in my mind causing my blood to boil, and for some reason, it did again when a friend called him 'bloody gay' in the school corridor. I imagined myself confronting him, but then it struck upon me that supporting a gay guy would result in me myself being stereotyped. I feared being treated the same way. I pulled myself back from that fear of abandonment. I could only support him in my heart, hoping a vibe would reach him. I felt his pain for being forced into feeling inferior by society's degrading stereotypes, but failed to support him there. Fears of ruining my image convinced me to stay silent, but my conscience didn't let me sleep at night. I was perplexed as conflicting thoughts echoed in my mind for days to come. Who was I to support Zia? I was nobody! My opinion did not really matter. If I tried to stand by him, the world would isolate me too. Was I ready for that? But the remorse I faced, and the memories of the n-word or seeing him walk through the school corridor with indifferent glances, continued to make me question my beliefs and non-action. Mustering up the courage, I invited him to lunch at my house. To my pleasant surprise, he accepted. My first close sitting with a gay person removed all my doubts about them. I found him a better intellectual and more humane; someone who had adapted to difficult life in this idiosyncratic society. I realized I was not afraid to show acceptance anymore, even in my demoralizing community. As I started publicly supporting him, school became completely different: my close friends started calling me a 'bloody gay supporter', but my own courage had won a true blessing: internal contentment .I accepted stares every time I was seen with him. Yet, I never let anything come between us. As I stepped up to give a speech on my farewell, the school boys shouted: 'Gay! Gay! Gay!' Not fumbling once, I began my speech, crediting my openness as a person to Zia, who had turned me into a responsible human being. It was hard to let everything come crashing down, but I turned out to be stronger. While everyone calls me gay, I call myself merely an open-minded human being."
"Information gap is an important challenge that our generation faces. I have worked in two NGOs, namely The Citizens Foundation and Mashal Foundation, which provided me with an opportunity to contribute to the working of primary schools in rural Pakistan. These experiences helped me realize a much deeper understanding of how communities suffering from lack of information are less likely to make sound decisions in many aspects of life, like education, moral and social responsibility, and environment protection to name a few. Many countries are facing these issues, and this a major cause of their inability to progress. This needs to be rectified amply if the world is to move forward because we live in a world of globalization where the actions of one nation directly affect other countries."
"I see college as a time where I can not only make independent choices, but can also learn how to think in a holistic manner. With the pressures and freedom of college life, I will be able to adapt into a more mature person, capable of making rational decisions. Coming from a small city, I never had the chance to live in a culturally diverse place. In college, I want to have a web of friends all over the world, hailing from different cultures and backgrounds, and having viewpoints different than my own. To make myself stronger academically and professionally, I am excited about research and internship opportunities. In that aspect, I see Atlanta as a perfect fit for me. Such experiences in and out of campus would give me a great time during college life and prepare me ideally for my future goals."
"DURING THE SECOND TERM AROUND JULY 2015, I WAS INFROMED THAT I HAD SPINA BIFIDA, A CONGENITAL DISEASE. SOMEHOW, HEARING THAT WAS MORE PAINFUL THAN THE SWOLLEN BACK. I FELT LIKE MY LIFE WAS OVER. EVERYBODY STARTED TREATING ME DIFFERENTLY FROM THE FEW FRIENDS THAT I HAD TO EVERY FAMILY MEMBER. THE TEACHERS ALWAYS HAD AN EXCUSE FOR NOT GIVING ME A TEST THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE TOO STRESSFUL AND I WAS DENIED HOUSEWORK. I WAS ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL IN CASUAL SHOES AND I WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE WHENEVER I WANTED. IT MADE ME FEEL ABNORMAL LIKE THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO SPARE ME FROM THE PAIN SO I DECIDED TO CHANGE THAT. I STOPPED RECEIVING MEDICATION ESPECIALLY THE PAIN KILLERS. I DO NOT EXERCISE BUT I DID WHATEVER I COULD AND MANAGED TO GET THROUGH THE PAIN. OF COURSE I STILL CAN NOT BEND, STAND FOR A LONG TIME OR STAND WITHOUT BUT I AM PROUD BECAUSE I CAN CARRY OUT MY ACTIVITIES WITHOUT THE MEDICATIONS. THE ENTIRE INCIDENT MADE ME REALIZE THAT I AM STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT. JUST BECAUSE I HAVE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THIS CONDITION, IT DOES NOT MEAN I SHOULD GIVE UP ON MY FUTURE GOALS OR MY LIFE. I STARTED JOGGING TO EXERCISE AND LEARN TO PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN. I IMPROVED ON MY DIET TO AVOID UNNECESSARY TRIPS TO AVOID MODE MEDICATIONS. THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE TURNED OUT TO ALSO BE GOOD BECAUSE IT FORCED ME TO PUSH MYSELF BOTH MENTALLY AD PHYSICALLY"
My ideal college campus is some place green so am not so home sick. A place where I am not left out academically or socially. I love the idea of studying even outside the allocated time so a university where the students and teachers are allowed that kind of balance is not a bad place to start. I hope to learn to associate better with other people
"My mother tells me all these stories about her friends and the fun they used to have. Since I did not get that in high school, am really hoping I'll get some stories of my own. I also have lots of interests, academically, and I'm looking forward to getting to dig a little deeper."
"Shortly before the Christmas of 2015, I found myself sharing Christmas festivities with a Muslim friend. Swirls of steam floated around us in the frigid air on that crisp December night. We walked together, admiring the brilliant Christmas decorations that draped the charming street. As I look back, I can't help but to ponder the moments where we had triumphed over hesitance and ignorance to ultimately be there together. I first met Azhar at a Model United Nations (MUN) conference. For me, MUN served a purpose far greater than solely competing to win the honor of ""Best Delegate"": it helped me to connect with others, and to finally find my voice. When I had first moved to Korea after seven years of sojourn in the United States, I had struggled to assimilate into the culture of a people I had been separated from for so long. My confidence in myself had faltered, and was by then almost nonexistent. I had very few friends, but through MUN, I managed to become rejuvenated. With my voice finally heard, I strove to spearhead resolute initiatives in public speaking, my self-confidence, and most importantly, dismantling my self-made barriers in order to develop relationships with true, warm people. I came to believe in myself and others- and I will forever treasure the human relationships I made through MUN, especially that with my friend, Azhar. While initially our friendship was marked with skepticism in each other's faith, we quickly came to recognize that it was not legitimate antagonism, but rather one built upon lack of proper education and insight regarding the complex layers underlying Christianity and Islam. As I look into myself, I recognize how easy it had been to fall into that pit of misguided fear. All my life I had dwelled in a homogenous community grounded upon the Christian ethos, and I had come to implicitly distrust other faiths. Yet despite my isolated upbringing, the first beam of light broke through in the form Azhar, who guided me to overcome our ideological barriers in order to develop a friendship founded upon mutual respect. Together, we discussed extensively about the beauty of our faiths. We marveled at historical similarities and at curious theological parallels. We were committed to correct the misconceptions we had fostered due to misleading propaganda. But at times, we were candid about chasms that separated our worldviews. I distinctly recall that when I told her I was gay, she gracefully acknowledged the stark difference between the her interpretation of Islam and the modern Western position regarding homosexuality; but we firmly reassured each other that ideological differences, while they clearly existed, would not fracture our bond. In this budding friendship, the guidance became reciprocal, and the day did eventually come when she finally embraced me for who I was; because as friends, we vowed to support each other even in times of uncertainty. Although t's been nearly a year since I last saw Azhar, I still clearly remember the rather absurd events surrounding our final goodbyes: The sight of me jogging beside the departing train, waving at her, must have been nothing short of being analogous to a crestfallen 1940s bride bidding adieu to her soldier husband. In the friendship we forged, there was an empowering common purpose we both possessed: one of unity. Our collective spirit embodied the good in humanity, and through our stride towards inclusivity, we spread our wings together."
"Sitting on the top shelf of my bookshelf are seven copies of my favorite book, Antoine de Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince. While the endearing watercolor prince is more or less the same on all seven covers, the titles, however, are quite different - The Little Prince, Le Petit Prince, El Principito, Hoshi no Oji-sama, Eorin Wangja, Der Kleine Prinz... Yet, this diverse array of The Little Princes preserves its common message of humanity. On rainy days, you can find me, flopped on my bed, surrounded by my various copies of this book that never fails to move me to tears. At times, I find myself pondering over the Japanese and Korean editions of this beloved story, marveling at the common structures of the two languages. For my love for this tale is grounded upon its universality in expressing humanity - whether our tortured thoughts or our bouts of simple joy."
"I find people to be my primary motivation to learn. To learn is to discover new information, and to shed irrelevant ones. I had for a period of time been reluctant to engage with people-especially children, whose excited cries petrified me. But after a month with Anton, my hesitance had dissipated into a faint whisper. His excitement and warmth pushed me to better myself, as exemplified in an encounter where I tentatively decided to test my rudimentary Russian with him. When he bounced into the library, I greeted him with a friendly, ""Privyet."" Hi. ""Zdravstvuyte,"" he responded, his round eyes wide open. I laughed. ""Sorry, that's not my level."" He giggled. ""That means hello."" Anton didn't discourage me despite the small blunder. Instead, he compelled me to explore deeper into my interests like no other ten year-old had before. People, whether adult of child, we concluded, possessed inquisitive minds."
"On May 27, 2004, I was a young boy tagging along with the students from my Mom's high school DECA chapter at the International Career Development Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. An exhausting day of DECA leadership activities behind us, we were unwinding in the hallway of our hotel as students prepared for the start of business competitions the following morning. Around me, DECA members from all corners of North America were meandering about the hotel and networking. Their natural passion for making connections on what had already been a tiring day piqued my curiosity, so I too decided to roam the hallways, idolizing the high school students whose shoes I hoped to fill one-day. Merely a few minutes into my adventure, a moment that changed my life forever occurred. Three DECA members, whom I had never met before, appeared seemingly out of nowhere, and they spiritedly approached me to introduce themselves. Because there is no such thing as a stranger at a DECA conference, we began to have a conversation, and I was genuinely surprised and impressed both by their affable personality and their gregarious nature, which allowed for a pleasant conversation with teenagers whom I admired. As an observant six-year-old who had a strong proclivity for eating pizza, it did not take me long to notice that their friends were a few rooms away devouring what I perceived as delicious pizza. Hence, I eagerly asked if I could join them for a slice, and much to my delight, they agreed! With my Mom's permission, I joined them for over an hour, during which we discussed all of my future aspirations and what being a high school student was like. The experience of being able to make new friends and learn the value of networking, even though I was still only in first grade, was an extraordinary one that has had an impact on my life even to this day. These were high school student leaders who clearly could have found something more enjoyable to do, yet they decided to take the time to reach out and make me feel welcomed. Their inclusive gesture was something that I undoubtedly took note of, as it demonstrated to me the importance of taking a moment to make someone feel valued who might otherwise feel invisible. Every day we are surrounded by people whose lives we can positively impact, and my experience fostered in me a passion for doing just that by appreciating people for their contributions. In addition, another impactful memory I have from that same conference is the Grand Opening Session, which occurred the next evening. I was in awe as I watched five student leaders stand center stage and captivate a crowd of 15,000 energetic DECA members. Never could I have imagined that I would one day stand in their place as the International Brand Ambassador and role model for over 215,000 aspiring business leaders across the country. However, that is exactly what happened this past April, when I was introduced as DECA's 2016-2017 Executive President. Everyone needs some form of inspiration in his or her life; inspiration that sparks a motivation to wake up each morning with the desire to become a better person and to make a positive change in the world. While a slice of pizza may seem like a minor source of inspiration, that was all I needed to make a connection which heightened my confidence and gave me a vision for the person whom I wanted to become. Fortunately, I believe that is the person whom I have grown into today."
"On July 8, 2015, the New York Stock Exchange and United Airlines experienced computer outages that caused ramifications around the world; money markets were stagnant, travel was restricted, and there was concern that other businesses and industries would falter at any moment. If an event such as this one can happen once, it almost certainly can be repeated, and we need to make sure that next time it does not leave us with permanent consequences. Regardless of what caused these occurrences, this should be used as a learning moment in which my generation ensures that we understand the risks associated with becoming a society overly dependent on technology. Without question, I agree that technological advances have enriched our daily lives, but with these conveniences come many risks, and we need to address those risks to guarantee a fruitful future."
"""Much of our time here revolves around doing things that make us uncomfortable. It is only in that discomfort that one is able to find themselves."" This quote from a current college student epitomizes the experience that I yearn for in a college education. Being dared to exceed expectations is something that frightens most people, yet for me, it is something that I view as a necessary step on the road to success. Emory is a place where I will be challenged; it is a stimulating community that will allow me to grow into the life-long scholar and leader who I aspire to become. This environment, along with a dedication to diversity and boundless research opportunities, is the reason I struggle to find a community in which I would feel more embraced than that at Emory."
"Another day at the barn means another drive home on I-684 with Dave. Dave Matthews band, of course; it's nice to listen to the musings of a total stranger. Dancing Nancies comes to a close and Dave asks a question: ""could I have been anyone other than me?"" On instinct, I respond, ""probably not, Dave,"" but immediately feel foolish and retort my answer. I'd never thought about being someone else. Of course, I wished that I were different. A jungle explorer or less frizzy haired without an addiction to that peanut butter brownie on the kitchen counter. But was it possible to not obsess over horses or not feel hope percolating when a sustainable energy bill passed through Congress? The passion and drive I feel to become part of positive change in the world can't be created or destroyed. It's a part of everything I do from helping my tutee Hugo spell ""dictionary"" to comforting the girl who fell off her pony. It's distinct in my solutions regarding the cycle of criminalization and my decision to take a gap year. I can't change that part of me. As I continue driving, Dave's lyrics still aren't sitting right. Did Dave forget the room left for self-improvement? Optimism is embedded in me too: an overzealous girl sitting in a car filled with empty coffee cups, running sneakers, and four overdue library books that I promise I'll return. I glance at the copy of Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell on the passenger seat and know I'm not the only one who works to better herself. I understand Dave's attempt to help his listeners embrace who they are, but we can always strive for better, and that's not something to be ashamed of. Dave's raspy voice changes tune: ""so be yourself, it ain't always easy. You try and try to get it right."" Life seems to be one giant test of character. At least the only tests administered are for me and by me. I turn off the ignition and pointedly remove various cups, horse show riding jackets, and riding equipment from the car. ""Wow!"" my mother exclaims as I hobble through the door, ""this is a pleasant surprise!"" I sheepishly laugh, place the various objects in their assigned locations, and plop down at the kitchen table for dinner. Topics at a Month family dinner range from a review of the week's calamities to my father starting yet again with, ""you know, there's a great Seinfeld about that."" We dive into the realms of politics, activism, economics, questions, and stories, reminding me how lucky I am to be part of this family. We converge our interests by imagining economically feasible sustainable energy plants with minimal job losses or by changing inner city music curriculums to focus on Hip-hop before classical techniques to inspire students to embrace music and find inspiration and motivation in potentially difficult situations. Each viewpoint expressed spurs me to explore new topics and be a more active citizen. More places to go. Books to read. People to meet. I'll continue to change and grow as a person, but it's important to listen to Dave and that awesome saxophone. Knowing when I like something or don't agree with an idea is imperative to personal growth. Whether it's attending political discussions, partaking in a feminist book club, or conducting research to resolve the cycle of criminalization, sticking up for what I believe in and not standing down when challenged strengthens the roots of me. There will be times when I want to sit in my horse's stall and let someone else take control, but I won't. I'll push myself as my family does to embrace who I am and continue to become the best me possible. I can't be anyone other than me, but I like that."
"I can't help but notice increasingly severe weather patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures. Climate change must be acknowledged and combatted to maintain our beautiful planet, but attempts to solve global warming are challenged by difficulties transitioning to renewable resources and losing industry to developing countries with fewer environmental reforms. My generation must create a legacy of sustainable policy and development. Many environmental problems are handled through initiatives like the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. My internship at the Global Partnerships Forum includes learning how diplomats, scientists, philanthropists, and citizens of different nations collaborate to achieve these goals. Additionally, I believe an effective path to change is through policy. At Emory, combining sustainability sciences with political science in classes like Environmental Policy will encourage me to dig into the history of creating environmental policy, and provide me with new ways to think about how to solve environmental problems."
"Martin Luther once said: ""if you want to change the world, pick up your pen and write."" While Jeannette Walls didn't start the Protestant Reformation or write the 95 Theses, her honesty and ability to convey emotions eloquently through writing brought The Glass Castle to the top of the New York Times's bestseller list. It's a memoir of triumph despite circumstances under which many would have crumbled. Jeannette's character and story make her my role model and encourage me to solve the problems of America's poor. Jeannette's triumph inspires me to motivate people who are confronting discouraging situations. I hope to channel Jeanette's vigor into making a difference in the lives of those less fortunate through political action. Jeannette became successful in her own endeavors because she was brave enough to write her story. Now I believe I can overcome obstacles encountered and make a difference in the world."
"My first encounter with the children of Kot Lakhpat prison- also known as Central Jail Lahore, and one of Pakistan's most notorious prisons- came some years ago when I tagged along with my father, a senior policeman, as he filed some paperwork at the prison offices. I was expecting to see only hardened criminals, their jeers, their bulging biceps and scorpion tattoos. But what I saw, walking towards the offices behind my father, were children in chains, their faces lowered and bleeding. I could barely believe it. All my life, I had told people proudly that my father worked night and day to ensure our cities were crime free. And yet, not once had I stopped to consider who exactly was being jailed, or if boys as old as me were rotting away in our prison cells. Furious, I asked my father why there were children inside Kot Lakhpat jail. He told me, matter-of-factly, that they were criminals. As I ventured across the broken down canteen, the bare brick rooms, the bloodied clothes lying in heaps, none of it felt right. A week later, against my father's wishes, I joined the Rehai organization- a non profit organization dedicated to the rehabilitation of juvenile criminals. My parents told me I would lay ruin to a reputation of fierce policing my father had taken his entire career to build. But I persisted, taking taxis on my own because I was refused the house car. I began to teach classes four days a week, taking baby steps at educating children who had never seen the inside of a classroom. I understood, there were much larger systemic institutions that had failed these kids, but there were small victories every day. A laugh out of them, a new theory learnt, another sum solved. I cannot imagine what it must have been like growing up the way these children did. Were they driven by hunger, abuse, desperation? I learnt that most of the children came from slum areas, and many said they were jailed under the pretext of false confessions obtained through illegal torture. I did not know some days how to process this information. They pleaded with me to help them, but I would only get back to teaching them math sums, telling them over and over again, that education was their only way out. In the two years since I've been teaching for Rehai, the rate of reoffenders in my class has been less than 5 percent. In March 2015, the government of Pakistan lifted completely, a moratorium on the death penalty in all cases of capital crimes. The day the children heard the news, there was panic in the classroom. For weeks, we had to suspend lessons and speak to them, calm them down and listen to their fears. It was an almost impossible challenge to return to my life with the burden of their terror still in my mind. My father recognized this and spoke to me about what I did for the first time. He gave me advice on how to speak to the children and explain the laws in a manner they could understand. In June 2015, the government of Pakistan executed Aftab Masih who had been a fifteen year old child at the time he was convicted of murder in 1992, allegedly after a false confession. After being jailed for over two decades, he was hanged at Kot Lakhpat jail. In a moving letter printed in The Guardian newspaper on the eve of his execution, Masih told the world that he was an artist and a painter, and asked the question, ""What purpose will my execution serve?"" In his memory, I have started painting lessons, so that in the barren, sunlit yard of the prison, there now lie dozens of brightly coloured pages painted with smiling figures- no chains, no prison bars. Just hopeful, brave and proud."
"I always wondered the crux of the reason of the ongoing war in the orient and occident. When I looked deeply into it, I saw that the race is for power. But what do they need for which they want power? Black gold. Yes, a major source of energy. The world is running out of fossil fuels at a tremendously fast rate. Even the smallest of manmade objects need fossil fuels to run and fossil fuels are currently the world's primary energy source. Our upcoming generations would be deprived of one the most basic necessities of life. Just the thought of the absence of fossil fuels to create power, and fuel sends shivers down my spine. I believe that the world will face an energy crisis within the next 50 years and we must start focusing on alternatives immediately."
"Persopolis by Marjane Satrapi is an autobiographical novel that portrays the struggles Satrapi had to go through in her childhood, during the peak of the Iranian Revolution. She was exposed to social pressures from a very young age . She was required to wear a veil, wasn't allowed to wear makeup, and could not wear any revealing clothing. The main reason I was attached to this book was because it gave a prominent role to women and coming from a country where women are suppressed and discouraged from pursuing educational and professional careers. I could directly relate to what Satrapi was going through. The book encouraged me to promote female rights in my country and I have set up a fund in my mother's name that provides free education to 10 deserving girls annually. Furthermore, as Persepolis is a graphic novel, the use of imagery made the story more captivating."
"I never imagined I would spend so much of my last term at Andover alone in the mirrored dance studio on dark Friday nights, holding a tattered copy of Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra in my sweaty hands. But when I decided to do an independent choreography project inspired by an Existentialism class, I found myself dancing my way through what turned out to be my most physically, emotionally, and intellectually satisfying undertaking at Andover. Dance has been a constant presence in my life since I began taking ""Creative Movement"" classes at my local studio at age three. Addicted to the feeling of motion, I pursued dance with my signature tenacity. My daily classes and rehearsals made me an athlete; performing made me an artist. Choosing to transfer to Andover in tenth grade meant leaving behind the pre-professional dance training to which I had access in Philadelphia. While I was excited to tackle new intellectual endeavors, I feared that this academic environment wouldn't sufficiently support my dance training. I thought attending Andover would mean sacrificing the level of athleticism and professionalism I had sought since I was a little girl. After a few dance classes at Andover, though, I realized I had found a creative, thriving dance environment that would push me as a thinker, performer, and person. At Andover, I took daily ballet and modern technique classes and was a member of Andover Dance Group, the advanced modern dance group in which we explored various improvisational techniques and learned from visiting choreographers. Participating in a dance program rooted so heavily in intellectual curiosity helped me discover the scholarly nature of dance. In elective classes such as Existentialism and Buddhism, I began to notice parallels between philosophical theories and dance. Existentialism is the study of free will and authenticity, and Buddhism centers around presence and ephemerality, all notions central to dance. I took a choreography class to explore these parallels and learned techniques for incorporating readings and texts into movement. Excited by the connections I was making, I created an independent choreography project. I researched and wrote academic papers to fuel my work, and discovered that although it is often regarded as merely a source of beauty and entertainment, dance can also serve to push boundaries, to spark conversations, to make us question our own lines of thinking, to be ugly and impractical and impure. I learned that dance could be a protest; it could be poetry. It could mean something. Each work of dance has context, history, and significance and can be taken apart and analyzed in the same way a poem might. I realized that my love for dance could and should connect closely with my love for academics. The dance studio became the place where I used movement to research complex questions of free will, loss, and love. I held Nietzsche's text open in my hands as I moved across the studio. I wrote poems, then translated them into movement. I closed my eyes, played music, and let myself move, turning everything I was feeling into a concrete truth. By incorporating what I learned in classes of all subjects at Andover, I managed to step away from preconceived notions of ""dance,"" becoming bold and authentic with my choreography. In Jean-Paul Sartre's ""No Exit,"" the protagonist proclaims, ""I am my freedom."" Andover helped me discover the points of connection between dance and academia, showing me that I don't need to sacrifice one passion for another. My endeavors aren't incompatible. By embracing what I learn in both the classroom and the dance studio, I have infinite potential not only to discover more about myself, but to create and contribute my own ideas to the academic and artistic world. I am, indeed, my freedom."
"My young life has been characterized by being a Latina female. Studying at Andover made me acutely aware of the importance of diversity to education. While our country grapples with centuries of oppression, I learned that the only way to proceed forward is to be empathetic toward my peers, to listen to them and understand their viewpoints. College, particularly a college like Emory, is a place where motivated, intelligent, creative, young people all come together to learn. It's like a larger, more diverse version of the Andover community. These students come from all over the world, and each one has a unique story. I would be so excited to meet and learn from these students, so we could work together to have an impact on both our immediate community and the country as a whole."
"""The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath"" reveals the complex, insightful, beautiful, and sometimes terrifying inner workings of a mind that was too intelligent for its own good. I read Plath's journals for the first time last summer, when I was seventeen, and was taken aback by the measure of sadness and creativity that Plath conveyed when she was the same age. Her young death seems inevitable when you read her journals. But her words also seem to reveal some measure of inexplicable optimism, a deep love for life, a hope for a different end. Plath's journals are heartbreaking but irresistible, and inspired me to observe the world more profoundly, to appreciate the goodness in my life and to fight back against any darkness. Even more so than her poetry, ""The Unabridged Journals"" changed my perspective and inspired me to be a better person and writer."
"Centuries ago a Prussian leader who had a fervent desire to unite the Germans through blood and iron affirmed that politics was the art of possible in order to explain his strategies.The world has gone through massive changes since he uttered those words.There have been wars of multiple scales, rise and fall of nation-states, global epidemics and enormous technological advancements; however, politics has remained intact. Just as stated in the past, it is still an art: unpredictable in character and fascinating in analysis. This statement has a vital importance to my understanding of politics today. It was introduced to me during my freshman year when I joined the Model UN club. My advisor was very fond of this definition, leading him to mention it very often. In order to explain its meaning, he would compare politics to Math, saying that Math problems will always have an exact answer, while in politics the answer can be anything. That's the beauty of this field-it's simply possible. And as human beings, we are active participants of the political life. In fact, we are all artists of the possible, always trying to influence one another through power interactions, which makes politics a genuine expression of the deepest aspects of the human experience. Through Model UN, I could further explore these very political aspects that are essential to our development as a society. Countries are constituted by people and, as matter of fact, led by people. Sometimes these leaders represent a majority, sometimes a minority, but they will always represent a particular set of interests. Consequently, those interests will have a substantial impact on their foreign policy, making international relations a magnificent baroque work of art molded by the consecutive antitheses and syntheses of the interest game. This idea became evident to me in 10th grade during my second BRAMUN. I went to a historical committee representing Turkey on a very delicate issue: the Cuban Missile Crisis. I had a strategic position: American missiles in my territory could offer some leverage to negotiate the removal of missiles from Cuba, even though no one was interested in exchange. This clash of interests led the house to a deadlock because the veto power from both the USSR and the USA blocked all resolutions brought to the floor. However, the possible happened. A crisis that brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war shifted the interests from the members involved. Now, our goal was to avoid a catastrophe, and the missile exchange was the only viable solution. So we sat, we lobbied, and we completed a resolution agreed by all members, saving the world from termination. Model UN simulations are not a perfect portrait of how international politics works, but they can certainly give an idea. And on that day, I could imagine how complex they can be. Inevitably, that event reminded me of 9th grade, and of everything that my advisor used to say, especially those words proclaimed by Otto Von Bismarck 149 year ago. On that day, I could finally understand what he meant. I could finally see how possible politics actually is, and most importantly, I understood that I could practice this peculiar form of art for the rest of my life."
"Creating a global economy that is capable of overcoming the cultural challenges posed by globalization while tackling inequality worldwide is a crucial feature to achieve a fairer and more harmonious world in the next 50 years. Globalization can be a very beneficial feature if it works for everyone. Currently, many people are feeling left out by this phenomenon, leading to increased political extremism and calls for cultural and economic isolationism. The only way to stop the rise of those ideas is by making globalization a more inclusive process and less culturally damaging to the ordinary citizens of the world. An inclusive globalization would also create a more inclusive world economy, and thus it would be easier to tackle economic inequality worldwide. Of course, all of those goals will be really hard to achieve, but it is a challenge that must be faced by this generation."
"The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevski is definitely my favorite book. It tells the story of 3 ordinary brothers from a Russian provincial town who face a moral dilema after the assassination of their patriarch-possibly a parricide. However, much more than the story of a murder, the novel is a dense philosophical work that explores the nature of humankind. The characters in the novel are accurate depictions of everything good and bad about human beings. The author wanted the reader to reflect on the best ways to live one's life; that's why he created these 3 brothers and released them into the world to see how each one would act. Apart from that, the book also raises important questions such as the morality of religion, the meaning of hell, the utopia of socialism, the pursuit of love, the price of redemption, and the sufferings of man."
"""Papillon, deploie tes ailes et envole-toi vers la lumiere."" (Butterfly, open your wings and fly towards the light.) - Le Papillon des Etoiles by Bernard Werber I discovered sealed boxes labeled ""fourth grade"" in storage. It had been six years since my family emigrated from Korea, but because of the frequent moves over the years, some of our belongings were perpetually being packed and unpacked in U-Haul boxes. In one such box, I picked up a book with a pretty metallic engraving of a butterfly: a copy of Le Papillon des Etoiles translated into Korean. The metallic butterfly jogged my memory of how my younger self had been so immersed in the story of escaping tarnished humanity on Earth and restarting civilization on a distant planet. Seven years later as a high school junior, I read the book in French. While in fourth grade Werber's creativity had drawn me into his microcosm parallel to our current world, I recently came to realize that his work isn't simply a work of science fiction. Instead, it is an expose on how society is ruining the Earth for future generations. The tarnished humanity Werber described was overlapped with the news of terrorism, hate, and insensitivity I read everyday. I started to worry about what would happen if the world continued as Werber foreshadowed; it prompted me to take responsive measures to improve the society around me. This epiphany initiated my first step of metamorphosis, my process of crawling out of boundaries to transform his words into action. My second stage of metamorphosis began in the summer of 2015 when I walked into the grandiose headquarters of Goldman Sachs in Manhattan for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. A confounding, yet encouraging feeling came over me, similar to that of the astronomer, Yves, when he first met and asked a billionaire for support to continue his mission in Le Papillon des Etoiles. Although the technical aspect of learning how to code captivated me, the best part was experiencing that I could make a truly meaningful difference in people's lives, as I co-created NuMe, a pregnancy tracking web application designed to assist low-income women. Watching working women test our website and getting positive feedback was both gratifying and motivating; I felt inspired to find more ways in which I could use my passion for technology to positively impact others. The next stage of my metamorphosis developed during my time as an intern at the United Nations. At the UN, I wanted to delve deeper into technological accessibility in the the world. After scouring the UN Library, I was disappointed with the scarcity of information on this issue. However, I was introduced to the manager of the Applications Development Team in the UN Population Fund. He invited me to demonstrate my project, NuMe. In the presentation, he gave me feedback for further improvement and we shared the passion of helping others using technology. He also introduced me to his team projects: developing drones to airdrop necessary health products for inaccessible geological areas, portable projectors to teach midwives about safe birth procedure, along with other programs ranging from smartphone application to wearable technology. I was elated to see that there are others out there who related to Werber's philosophy to make the world a better place. My final stage is yet to come. Breaking out of the chrysalis, I'm starting to see what the world has to offer; for me, it's more positive than the one Yves and Le Papillon des Etoiles had left behind. Whichever stage I am in, wherever I may be, I know that there will be people who believe in the good of the world. The crucial piece that Werber missed when he judged the humanity was hope and compassion. Unlike Yves, I chose to stay, and from here, I can choose where to fly."
"As an only child, I'm dying to write about how excited I am for my freedom away from home in college. But I won't. One of many reasons why I can't wait until the next school year is the intellectual freedom to explore variety of subjects I've never had the chance to learn, such as Middle Eastern studies and Neuroscience in addition to my potential major, computer science. As a craver for an interdisciplinary research, study of various academic fields will be my assets for collaboration with researchers from different areas. In high school, it is difficult to meet and interact with people with very diverse backgrounds. In college, I look forward to meeting new friends from across the globe with very different life experiences, varying perspectives, and unique traditions. I'm excited to spend the next four years with peers who are just as interested in engaging in intriguing conversations."
"My grandmother is my source of inspiration and motivation for learning. Since she could not attend college as a woman in her 20s in South Korea, she went to college at 63 years old, even receiving honors and scholarships throughout her schooling. Even to this day, she always tells me that women of my generation have the responsibility to work hard for ambitious women from the old generation who were never given the chance to get educated or have a career. Watching my grandmother study hard for her exams, I was inspired by her passion for learning. If I struggle with a subject, I remember that my grandma was able to do it all, on top of all the housework she had to do for the family. Whenever I think of her, it makes me push myself harder to do well in school to make her proud."
"Five Friends This past summer, my friends and I took a hiking trip together. We ended up in front a trail up the Appalachian Mountains. We all looked at each other, and we instinctively knew what we were all thinking. Should we venture out into the unknown - this infinitely long trail? My American name is Joseph, but building my personality around this name has been quite an endeavor. Because of my father's career, I arrived from Taiwan to Atlanta, Georgia during 8th grade. Between pecking ordered gym classes and cliquey, segregated cafeteria spaces, I realized I needed to reinvent myself. Although in Korea and Taiwan, I was normally outspoken and opinionated, my lack of communication in English defaulted me to the typical Asian stereotype of passive, reticent nerdy student. But, it wasn't who I was. Following advice from my mother, I let myself stay open and vulnerable but quickly found out that most people tended to run away or pounce, not embracing that kind of state of mind. A couple of months passed by with very little return, except alienation and isolation, but then, I met Albert. Albert is the only person from our group who was born and raised in Georgia. Despite the fact that he has complicated family issues, he is a natural born comedian, very quick on his feet. He has a face capable of making a million funny faces, a Korean Seth Rogen. I first met him at a freshman Marching Band camp. It was at that camp, we became close, and I knew that I needed to assimilate his humor and charm. From Albert, tacitly at first, I began to open up to a brand new world of laughter and a different perspective of people, society, and the little things. Joey was born in Texas; fittingly, he has a stocky, linebacker-type frame. Initially, when we first met in middle school, I was afraid of him. But, during lunch, I quickly realized unlike his intimidating exterior, on the inside, Joey is a thoughtful, gentlemanly character who goes out of his way to make others feel comfortable. It suddenly clicked something in my mind that that etiquette was so necessary in this life. From Joey, I mimicked his caring nature sacrificing his own comfort for the sake of others. He's also a fierce debater, which helped me improved my logical verbal skills. Max came from Korea around the same time I did, so we ended up ESOL buddies. He was my first friend in America, and we had similar intellectual pursuits and curiosities. Yet, he has a distinctive independent personality. He isn't afraid of being labeled a ""nerd"" and doesn't feel the need to conform to any of the social pressures of Friday and Saturday nights. He's the best target for our pranks, but he takes all of them with stride. From Max, I felt the stability of being your own person and spirit of calm, quiet strength. Justin is from Louisiana. In a nutshell, he is Mr. Popularity. He dresses impeccably and extremely adept at basketball. We all envy his prowess at procuring dates, and he lives perpetually in a sea of girls. He no longer attends our high school, but he comes often to spend time with us. From Justin, I learned that fashion and taste is an important quality that is needed to attract people. And lastly, there's me. I'm the mediator/ leader of the group. I assemble and disassemble our gatherings. So, back at that trail, having agreed to set out, we ended up four hours into the hike when Albert and Max exhausted from the walk abruptly wanted to go back. In those couple moments of indecision, I saw the road traveled and the road ahead. I found myself surrounded by my best friends, and I realized they looked to me for guidance. I, too, was the best parts of them."
"With the recent votes for Brexit and Donald Trump, there is a movement that proves a quagmire to policy makers and every pundit in academia: globalism versus nationalism. I believe that this will be the important challenge facing our generation in the next 50 years. Globalists and nationalists are polar opposites in every facet of beliefs and worldviews. For example, nationalists believe that true nation has a clear, protected border that serves to protect the nation's cultural heritage. On the other hand, globalists want to redefine borders. They believe in an integrated world with open markets for the betterment of every region on every continent despite national sovereignty. This opposition comes to boil on subjects like foreign policy, distribution of resources, trade, and cultural heritage. For this reason, I believe that our generation will have to make difficult choices relying on strong academic research and pursuits, not government or media."
"I was a child who was not that interested in watching television. However, I began watching this particular television show when I entered middle school called Modern Family to learn English. Modern Family is a unique television show that is told from the perspective of an unseen documentary filmmaker; the series offers an honest, often-hilarious perspective of family life. Each family presents diverse characters from all backgrounds and cultures, including babies, teenagers, elders, homosexuals, a tiger mom, a clueless dad and guests. The practical realities of scenarios dealing with difficult topics opened my mind to accept different lifestyles and value others' opinions. This show is my favorite television show because it humorously represents America with diverse cultures living under ""one roof"". Ultimately, the show opened up my eyes to look past my own prejudices and support people who are different."
"As long as I can remember, I have been the living embodiment of multiculturalism. It's rare for someone to identify with more than three cultures- in my case Botswana, Korea, and Malaysia- but I'm an exception. Although I am ethnically Asian, I was born in Botswana and will always identify myself as an African. Like many Botswanan natives, my personal identity is rooted in the culture and history of my country. But life hasn't always been so simple: in my formative years, I did not readily embrace this idea of being a human melting pot. Other students would sometimes play upon my insecurities by asking me ridiculous questions, such as ""Do you ride an elephant to school?"" I, of course, answered ""yes"" just to indulge their curiosities. Although deep inside, these insensitive epithets made me feel like an outsider. It was only after a meeting three years ago that I learned not only to embrace my heritage, but also to start educating my peers about the benefits of multicultural integration and compassion. I vividly remember sitting on a leather couch centered in the room with curious eyes fixated on me. I was nervous and tried my best to distract my anxious mind. I began to examine the intricate objects scattered across the room: a sculpted giraffe, a charismatic wooden lion, and paintings of San Bushmen. Suddenly, hearing the twisting of a doorknob, my entire body jolted with excitement. The door slowly opened, and there he was standing before me - the third president of Botswana, President Festus Mogae. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the project that I had recently founded called 7equals1 (7 Continents Equals 1 World), an organization aimed at breaking down cultural barriers by promoting cultural acceptance and unity. The meeting laid the foundation for a plethora of interviews, and events that would become my life's passion; the most formative being a cultural summit I hosted through 7equals1 at the New College of Florida. The event featured three sessions: a panel discussion, a variety of cultural performances, and unique cuisines. Aside from all the delicious food and entertainment, there was one particular story from this event that I have reflected on over and over again. A panelist shared with us a first-hand experience of racial discrimination, in which he applied for a job at a predominately White firm and was subsequently denied based on spurious reasons. Rather than focusing on the negative, however, he used this troubling circumstance as the fuel that inspired him to take action against racism. In addition, his story helped me realize that I wasn't the only person facing this type of problem. As the event came to a close, a dozen or so people came to me and asked some questions. One that resonated was: ""Why was this event so important to me?"" The answer was simple. America is going through a racial crisis that is dividing the country, evidenced by the civil unrest that has culminated in the Black Lives Matter movement. It seems like every week there is either a racial protest or stories of unwarranted police brutality. To this day, even professional athletes refuse to stand for the national anthem. A barrier of mistrust and negative stereotyping has been built on both sides. All these issues are creating silos that divide America along racial lines, harkening back to the days of Civil Rights movement. Sadly, these problems are not just limited to America; rather, they transcend all seven continents. Together, we all need to start thinking more globally. This belief inspired me to create 7equals1, and to encourage this, and future, generations to create one unified, peaceful world. The purpose of 7equals1 is to break down racial and cultural barriers, to teach people to embrace other cultures. Through my organization, I aim to make the world a more cohesive community and a better place for future generations."
"Our world is globalizing at an extraordinary rate. Each year, millions of people migrate across the globe in search of better opportunities. For example, just a few years ago, only about 10 percent of American students studied abroad. Today, more than half of all American students study in foreign countries. Just a few years ago, only 1 to 2 percent of American college students were international students. Now that number is up to 10 percent. Of course, these increases in numbers are signs that we are truly becoming a global community. However, greater globalization also leads to more necessary racial integration and the potential for cultural clashes. Multiculturalism is often overlooked or regarded as unnecessary, but it is an imperative challenge that we need to face in the next 50 years. No matter where we are from, and regardless of race, it is important that we break down cultural barriers and unite."
"My passion for helping others motivates me to learn. During middle school, after school, most of our teachers would often leave early and we wouldn't have such classes such as study hall. We would simply do our homework by ourselves and hand it in. Often, I would find myself helping students with either their math or French homework. I figured that by placing myself in this type of collaborative environment, I would grow too. Since those early days in middle school, my motivation to learn has evolved into a more grand and altruistic ambition. Now, I am motivated to learn because I want to help those who need it most, especially the underprivileged in my native country, Botswana. It is my hope for a better, brighter future that motivates me to learn. I want to educate and lead the next generation of individuals, so society continues to make progress."
"When I was twelve years old, I made the life-changing decision to go alone to study in an all-boys boarding school in India. I held great hopes of becoming strong, independent and valiant. Here's what my decision has led to: Multiple cases of vomiting and nausea; crashing in the infirmary once a month; prohibition from using electronic devices; consumption of rice, dhal, and chapatti every single day; transition from fat to ribs within three months; severe case of homesickness; contracting fungus on my face because there was fungus growing on the breads, on the shoes....everywhere; receiving the outcast status due to my poor conformity to school rules and culture; making a few enemies after I was involved in a brawl over an extra boiled egg (a boiled egg is invaluable there); and finally completion of the first year with a black eye so swollen that the ""you should see the other guy"" line always fell flat. Sounds like I made a very bad choice, doesn't it? I know many people think a boarding school itself is a horrid idea. Initially, that's what I thought, too. Returning home for the winter break with a blatant mark of defeat on my face was far more humiliating than the defeat itself. Adding salt to the wound, my dear mother refused to hug me at first because she couldn't recognize me in my new state: emaciated, bruised and fungus-infested. For many nights, I relived the homesickness despite being at home, the hunger despite having plenty to eat, the bashing even after my eye healed. At some point, one realizes the only way to overcome shame and fear is by confronting them. This realization was the cause for my return to the boarding school the following year. Yes, I was going to make the same bad choice again. But this time, the results were different: Immune system boost after much endurance; utilization of the absence of gadgets for time to contemplate about life and future plans; appreciation of food irrespective of taste and frequency; a moment of eureka for a new diet plan; adjustment of the boarding school as my home; building immunity that prevented fungus growth; learning to accept and adapt to a standard and culture unfamiliar to me; making friends after I was involved in the sharing of an invaluable boiled egg; experiencing solidarity with my peers whom I still call my brothers; and finally completion of my sixth year with confidence and pride of overcoming the challenges and living with the choices I made. What initially seemed to be the worst choice I've ever made turned out to be my greatest. My experiences taught me that we have to go all the way to really assess what is good and bad. With this hard-earned lens to view life in a different way, I repeat this mantra to myself every time I make a new decision: ""Have courage. Have patience. You can never know until you go all the way. Your worst decision may turn out to be your best one."""
"The two protagonists of Death of a Salesman, Willy and Biff Loman, were like parts of me that were embroiled in bitter conflict about how I should live my life. Willy resembled a part of me that was pressured to be superficially successful. My Willy side wanted to be recognized as an accomplished man with immense wealth and prestige. Biff resonated with my true self; the one who loves philosophy, art, nature, and living in the moment. My Biff side wanted to live life doing what he loved to do rather than meet the standards set by society. I truly love this play because it has changed the way I decided to live in the future. By reading my inner conflicts in a story, I could see myself in another perspective and painfully examine the validity of the American Dream. Yes, the play eventually helped my Biff side emerge victorious."
"I am fascinated by the long-term and widespread impact of ideas. 2,500 years after his death, Confucius, who encouraged harmony and mutual respect, still influences Far Eastern culture. However, Ideas are also capable of immense destruction. Nazism, which bred hatred and division, costed the lives of millions and the sufferings of many more. Though we don't necessarily see these political theorists and philosophers actively spreading their ideas to the people, they shape the course of mankind with the views they share with the world and thus carry a great deal of responsibility. I am motivated to learn because I wish to positively affect the greatest number of people. I want to develop my wisdom, intelligence, and sense of morality to be fit for such a responsibility. I truly believe that this is one of the noblest ways to be in the service of humanity"
"I am alone on the last train home, staring blankly across the carriage. Today marked the last qualifiers for the 2013 World Junior Fencing Championship. The light from passing stations refracts against the tinted windows to produce the faint receding image of a 17-year-old, fencing mask in one hand and three foils in the other. The window acts as an infinity mirror, compounding my exhaustion and uncertainty in each iteration. 8 victories had qualified me for youth fencing's biggest stage. Yet I had the gnawing feeling that something was amiss in the sport I loved. Shouldn't everyone have equal footing? My mind wasn't on the accomplishment, but was fixated on one win in particular. I am trailing 4-8 in the second round, on the back foot with only two periods left. Hearing the referee call an end to the break, my opponent, Ahmad, and I move to recommence our duel - except we don't. In fencing, touches are registered by contact between one's blade and opponent's jacket; Ahmad's jacket didn't register Seizing the delay, I immediately start strategizing. Feint to the cut, followed by a coupe to the sixte. Respond with two-step advance and second-intention parry riposte. I scarcely notice Ahmad frantically trying on new lame jackets, his coach pleading with the referee. Ahmad - particularly tall and left-handed - had no spare jacket, and none of his teammates' jackets had the regulation fit. My reverie was broken by my coach exuberantly exclaiming that I had done it. I notice Ahmad's expression, see the referee signal to me with his arm outstretched, and everything clicks into place - immediate disqualification for equipment failure. I had ""won"". The match ends with a shake of our hands, the tautness of Ahmad's grip saying more than words ever could. I knew he trained at a club in Singapore's outskirts - areas farther from city central in both distance and wealth - and likely didn't have the resources of most fencers. That day's events revealed a side of sports that I became acutely aware of: the complex matrices of social inequality that permeate everyday life, from private coaching to high-grade equipment. We fencers imagine ourselves as heirs to the musketeers of old: noblemen for whom prowess in battle was only second to honor. That day, I saw a more insidious parallel. Fencing is an expensive sport, and the ""basic"" requirements have hefty price tags. From masks and blades to plastrons and shoes, merely starting requires a small fortune that not every family can afford - let alone sustain over years of competition. Though I was never blind to this, I didn't realize the large shadow it casts over fencing. That Ahmad had gotten as far as he had was a testament to his perseverance; that he had been denied the opportunity to progress further left me feeling uncomfortable. The competitor in me chafed at the circumstances of my win as it dawned on me that one's merit is modulated by socioeconomic factors. Since then, I have made efforts to see a change in my sport. Over the last two years, I have organized fencing outreach workshops for less-privileged fencers as well as raised funds to provide training and full sets of gear for domestic competitions. I've partnered with National Fencing Singapore's talent development scheme, which is helping to create an upcoming generation of fencers that are the best in our history. There is nowhere I feel as alive as I do on a piste. Far from diminishing my love for Fencing, that bout has made me more determined to do my part. I may still wear a mask in competitions, but I am no longer blind to the fact that the realities of this game don't end with a salute."
"My ideal college environment is populated by ""do-ers"" - passionate individuals who I can learn from and collaborate with. I am keen on applied research, such as Professor Gregory Berns' work in neurobiology and decision-making at the Facility for Education and Research in Neuroscience. The idea that we can derive predictive trends for pop music sales - as he did - by using fMRI technology is fascinating and represents the kind of in-depth experiential learning I seek. However, passion need not be purely academic - the same love for fencing that drove me as a competitor led me to volunteer as an outreach coach for underprivileged youths. The OSLS' Vision in Action Program is one of several standout opportunities to realize my ambitions for sports-driven social change. I most look forward to being a part of a cohort as diverse as it is ambitious - I look forward to Emory."
"My education thus far has allowed me a brief glance over the figurative shoulders of Newton's giants, yet I have fallen in love with the view. As a keen student of the sciences - both natural and social - my foremost motivation is exploring all that a liberal arts education has to offer. Of particular interest is the intricacies of the complex systems that make up our world: from the billions of synapses that form our brain's neural network to the innumerable stochastic macro- and micro-economic variables that nonetheless resolve into market equilibria. Rather than learn subjects in silos, I instead hope to traverse the vast intellectual vista before me and pay attention to the transitional terrain between subjects. A flexible but solid academic foundation is essential to this end: not only because of the quantitative and critical reasoning skills it will engender, but also for its own sake."
"On the evening of Wednesday, September 30, 2015, the sky was on fire. As I exited Good Samaritan Hospital after three hours of volunteering, the horizon erupted with an uncontrollable array of neon oranges and yellows. As I walked to my car, the night sky emerged and muted the vibrant colors; suddenly, a mixture of melancholy and gratitude overpowered my body and mind-- I recognized how fortunate I was to be a part of this incredible world. As the sun sank below the horizon, a thought I set aside for months crept back into my mind. Exactly a year ago, on the last week of September 2014, I was also in the hospital, but as a patient. Struggling with depression and anxiety since I was eleven, I attempted to take my life, and was brought to the PICU at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. I realized upon my discharge I would be placed back into the reality I tried to escape from just days before. I knew that I could no longer continue the life I had prior to my hospitalization; instead, I was determined to set aside everything and devote my time and energy to getting better, both mentally and physically. These following months marked a major turning point in my recovery-- the hospitalization was a wake up call that helped me let go and accept the consequences of my past, and in turn, approach my life in a way that would give me a sense of purpose and personal meaning. The first thing I wanted to do was to volunteer at hospitals. Doctors and nurses had helped me during the lowest points in my life; although I could not directly repay them for their services and compassion, I knew volunteering would give me the power to help make nurses' lives less hectic, brighten patients' day, and comfort worried visitors. Gradually, I became aware of how I felt after volunteering-- it was a sense of appreciation and joy, emotions I had denied for a long time. Not only did my services allow me to pay it forward to the hospital community, I also gained a sense of fulfillment knowing my actions were bringing positivity to others who may be suffering in this world. In this period of self discovery, I also joined my school's Winter Percussion group. Dance had served as my creative outlet for eleven years, and I was eager to try a less demanding activity that also incorporated music, movement, and self-expression. Soon after joining, I unexpectedly discovered something that was previously lacking from my life-- I finally felt a genuine sense of belonging. I met people whom I easily bonded with, and as a team, we worked our way to competing at World Championships. Through Percussion, I developed meaningful and healthy relationships, and found my best friends. That evening, as I drove home watching the thick, dark clouds smother the remainder of the burning sky, I realized why my emotions were so bittersweet. A year prior, I was given a second chance; with the help of family and friends, and the discovery of volunteering and Percussion, I was able to pick myself back up. I have been fortunate enough to continue living a life with people who cared for me, to continue high school without repeating a grade, to find activities and people I felt connected with, and most of all, to have a healthy and functioning body and mind. Once again, it is September, but this time it will be the last one before I enter adulthood. As I experience the college application process, I realize that two years ago, I could not have pictured myself reaching this point. Though I am unsure of where I will be watching the sunset next September, I know that wherever I am, I will have the confidence and strength to take on this next stage of my life."
"My favorite book, The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, written by late neurologist Oliver Sacks, was recommended by my psychology professor. Each chapter tells a short story about one of Sacks's odd encounters during his practice, followed by a postscript explaining his discoveries and reasonings behind the neurological disease. As I read through these case studies, I was exposed to stories that challenged the relationship between the human body and mind. Having grandparents who suffered from neurological disorders, I was eager to learn more about these phenomena and the understanding of how they develop. Sacks's clinical tales create the perfect balance between a leisure read and an informative work on psychology. Though neuroscience can be complex, Sacks's writing breaks these concepts into layman's term in order to educate the audience about the hows and whys of serious neurological disorders."
"My ideal college campus is very similar to the student life present at Emory. For me, the most important feature of a college is a welcoming and inclusive community. A quality education starts with an environment where I can collaborate with other students who share a genuine drive to learn and help others. In this accepting community, I will be able to speak my mind and engage in controversial but stimulating conversations. The ideal academic setting would allow me to extend the intellectual curiosity present in the classroom and apply it in real life situations, including determining how best to serve the community. A campus with these qualities will allow me to thrive during my four years at college. Not only will I feel a sense of belonging, I know I will form meaningful and long lasting friendships with people who share the same values as me."
"It is not uncommon for a person to feel like they have almost two different personalities in one. In my case, the determining factor between one of my personalities and the other is language: ""Spanish Carla,"" who speaks her native language, and ""English Carla,"" who speaks her second. When I speak English, my favorite foreign language, I live the adventurous side of my life: the one spent traveling, soaking up stories from foreign countries, and diving into a new languages and cultures. These two sides of me are identical in appearance and similar to the onlooker, but to me, they are very different. Wake up, go to school in the morning, have lunch with my friends or mother, then spend the afternoon at my mother's office helping her with office tasks or doing my homework before going home, showering and preparing to repeat the routine. ""Spanish"" Carla is used to routines. ""English"" Carla hates them. She believes that she can always find something to ""spice up"" her day a little, and most of the times she is right. ""English"" Carla does not settle easily, so after insisting with her parents, she packs her bags and goes abroad. Sometimes to an English speaking country, like England or Australia, and sometimes to a country where she does not even speak the language, - her biggest challenge -the Czech Republic. Long before I learned English and ventured out on my own, I was born to two well-intentioned but overprotective parents, as were most of my friends. We led lives guided by family-oriented Argentine rituals and traditions. Luckily, with a bit of insistence, my parents encouraged me to travel and place myself in multicultural situations that often caught me off-guard, and challenged me to think on my toes and have an open mind. Since I took my first trip alone at age fifteen, I haven't stopped. ""English"" Carla has made ""Spanish"" Carla a better person in many ways, and on each of my trips, I become enriched my life with the gift of new experiences and become more of the adult that I aspire to be. I have learned to be punctual through realizing that even if I arrive two seconds late, I could miss a train and end up in another country. I have learned that there are people out there that share your interests, and will enjoy them with you, if you are brave enough to leave your comfort zone and befriend them. Traveling, and the struggles that come with becoming accustomed to a new place, learning a new language and making friends made me more tolerant of others and aware of their problems. Traveling and immersing myself in other languages and cultures has also helped me understand how people fit, or do not fit, into their own cultures. I have never completely fit in at home, as the side of me that sought adventure and became tired of routine competes with the side of me that finds comfort in family rituals and tradition. But while ""Spanish"" me and ""English"" me are different, they are, of course, the same person. Depending on the situation, one will shine, but the other will be there in case the other needs help. As an international student in the United States, I have no doubt that ""English"" Carla will have the time of her life while ""Spanish"" Carla takes time to adjust. ""English"" Carla will love the stimulation and activity of a college campus and new friends from all over the world, while ""Spanish"" Carla might miss the comfort of old routines and cultural practices. But I believe that with the passing of time, I will emerge confident with a whole new set of adventures both behind and ahead of me."
"One of the biggest challenges my generation is facing is media coverage. We have access to more information than ever thanks to the Internet, and anyone can become a ""reporter"" if they are in the right place at the right time with a camera or Twitter account, but this means that there is a great deal of fake articles and stories. The desire for recognition or to ""go viral"" has become more important than respecting the truth and the impact that spreading lies can have. I believe our generation will be responsible for redefining the way we get our news and shape our reality through the information presented to us."
"What I'm looking forward to my college experience is everything. I want to meet new people that share the same interest as me, and also people who do not. I'm excited to learn and study in a way I haven't before. I look forward to the small things, like having a roommate and to sharing a bathroom (things I've never done in Argentina). And what I'm most excited about is to be part of the university community, to join campus organizations, and to make long-lasting connections with people. I can't really choose one thing because I am so excited about everything that an Emory education would allow me."
"Sudan seemed so distant after I moved to the United States. But little did I know, things would change immediately on the day my grandfather died. My grandmother called home, wanting to talk to my mom, and she would call home nearly every week afterwards. My parents tried to keep his death a secret, but we lived in a cramped apartment, so I could hear my mom's crying and my dad's attempts to comfort her. I never forgot my time in Sudan, how I played soccer in the dirty sandlot outside my home and how my friends and I would catch scorpions. My parents said the move to America was temporary, and I believed them. Nothing they said turned out to be as permanent as the ""temporary move"", but I now see why we left. As a kid, I never went through what my parents did. I didn't have to work on the farm to try and harvest whatever dried-out produce our land could manage to cultivate. I didn't have to drive to Khartoum so I could sell it to starving families, and I certainly never told them ""no"" when they didn't have money. I lived a life of privilege in Sudan, a life that made me so guilty I didn't want to remember it. After my grandfather's death, I started thinking about how I'd drifted away from Sudan while living in the United States. My name, Ahmed Ahmed, was off-sounding to Americans, so I tried to keep my distance from all things Arabic; around my friends I was ""American"", trying my best to fight my accent and play dumb when they talked about Islam. But there was something deeper, something that I knew was driving me to learn more about my roots. Maybe it was because I was an African living in America, and I wanted my own cultural identity. Maybe it was because I felt guilty living in America while my grandmother suffered in Sudan. Or maybe it was because I had promised myself to become literate in Arabic like my grandfather wanted. I pushed myself to learn more about Arabic history and traditions, and as I learned more about Sudan, I realized how much I actually liked the history of my native country. I looked through online sources, books and even my video games for every tidbit, every parcel of information I could find on Sudan. I spent my afternoons at the public library reading about the conflict in Darfur, and when I got home I would continue reading books from my father's shelves on Sudan's post-British colonial development. I was surprised that I became so infatuated with history, as I used to see it as something mundane and static, something that was irrelevant because it already happened. However, reading about how the Mahdi almost kicked the British out of Sudan, or how Italy almost took over Sudan during World War 2, gave me vivid pictures of thousands of tribesmen defending their lands and crafted an almost surreal image of how it must have been for my family. History became a channel through which I learned more about my friends, my family, and myself. It gave me the power to deeply connect with the people I loved, connections that I didn't think I had. The next time my grandmother called me, I eagerly picked up the phone. ""Salam Haboba,"" I said. As I tried to talk to her in Arabic, I asked her to talk about all the history she's lived through in Sudan. She told me all about the Sudanese Civil War and what she remembered from British rule, and for the first time, I listened. My grandmother ended our call by telling me that she's proud that I'm practicing my Arabic and that I'm more interested in my culture, and for the first time since I came to America, I truly felt close to Sudan."
"As I entered my U.S. Government class, I saw that my teacher had prepared a video for the class to watch: ""Humans Need Not Apply"" by CGP Grey. The lesson that day was on government entitlements, and how they might be expanded if human jobs were outsourced to robots. After watching Grey's video, I realized that my generation is poised to face never before seen employment challenges. Throughout the video, Grey explains that contemporary technologies could edge out manual laborers, white collar workers, and even professionals such as doctors. In the future, technology may render millions of peoples' skills obsolete through no fault of their own. Uber seems convenient now, but its self-driving car stands to leave 3 million people unemployed in just one industry. The question of automation is profoundly important because humanity will have to balance upcoming technological progress with ensuring that everyone can pursue a decent livelihood."
"I have always found myself drawn to my history classes because I'm fascinated by the way past rulers and bureaucracies managed their sprawling realms, and I'm interested in how we can learn from the past to better manage countries today. Despite my affinity for history, I ventured into the natural sciences after I watched ""Print Your Own Medicine"", a TedTalk by Lee Cronin. I normally find science to be mundane, but learning about 3-D printed drugs was both fascinating and challenging. I didn't fully understand all of the concepts, so I found multiple online forums that explained unfamiliar terms such as ""vessels"" and ""chemical inks."" I realized that I enjoyed Cronin's TedTalk because it forced me to fill in the gaps of my knowledge about a topic that can profoundly impact how human societies will develop and prosper - the same reason that makes learning about history so intellectually fulfilling."
"Don't look at panhandlers. Be respectful, but don't show any empathy. Do not express anger at anyone throwing bottles at you. Keep your ""New York"" on. I repeated these words to myself each day I left home for work. I worked as a grassroots promoter for the Fairway grocery chain for five months, advertising summer sales to strangers in the streets. As a formerly shy person, the notion of grabbing strangers' attentions was daunting. I promised myself that, by mid-September, I'd transform into a charismatic campaigner. I'd pursue my goal the way my family taught me. We never allowed ourselves much vulnerability. Despite financial issues, illnesses, and dysfunction, we never fixated on these trials because that empowered them. When someone died, we never cried together; we'd clap each other's backs with curt smiles and plan the next week undeterred. With that mindset, I steeled myself against uncomfortable encounters and reminded myself that they were nothing new. This strategy sufficed until a day in mid-August. I had reached my usual spot at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue before two police officers began to approach my corner. They scanned the avenue, as officers do, but they slowed their pace as they passed my block. As they hovered towards me, their stances grew stiffer, their gazes lingering on my spot. Passers-by began to distance themselves from me. One pointed a hand at my I.D. card as another gritted his teeth, squinting his eyes at me. I aligned my I.D. card with my shirt, but the squinting cop still pulled out his receiver and locked eyes with me. In desperation, I looked around my area for potential escape paths like I'd look for a teacher when I sensed a schoolyard bully nearby. Here, the situation switched: the authority figure had taken the bully's side. I backed myself into a corner, but the officers still snaked towards me. Suddenly, the second officer touched her partner's arm and signaled to walk away. I stood frozen as they departed. The encounter lasted nearly fifteen minutes. I waited five minutes, then packed up my station to sit at a bus stop. I couldn't move. I left work early that day and didn't tell anyone. The officers did not explicitly threaten me; our interaction didn't result in flashing smartphone cameras, or a restrained eighteen year old girl pleading with conflicted bypassers. Still, I felt them mocking me through their intimidation tactics, exercising their power over me. While I'd done nothing wrong, they still spawned a destabilizing fear in me. I buckled over and cried during my train ride home. I couldn't gauge why I was crying until one commuter asked me if someone had died. She listened with somber eyes and a fixed pose as I explained my situation to her in ways unprecedented with my own family. I recalled my old bravado and wished for that to placate my thoughts. I hadn't understood that my bravado implied immunity that I never possessed. My few months at Fairway revealed the faults of my family's approach to vulnerability. We denied the challenges, however transparent, that made us susceptible to others since we believed doing so strengthened us. Because we collectively avoided our vulnerabilities, I couldn't develop the skills to confront them. I willingly weakened myself to feign fortitude. When those cops startled me, I panicked. I realized that I couldn't elude my reality; I cannot outrun my fears. Ignoring my vulnerabilities was similar to bottling up my emotions: both result in panic in order to channel nervous energy. While some can intuitively control that panic, I've discovered that I can't manage it alone. I've begun to share more of my frustrations with my friends, and slowly, my own family. Now when I leave the house and tell myself, ""Keep your New York on,"" I still don my usual poker face, but I remove it among those I love."
"Society's most significant challenge over the next fifty years will be apathy. I have observed people's tendencies to deemphasize current global issues like refugee crises in Syria and Ukraine, or the exponentially increasing gap between upper and lower socioeconomic classes. We are more comfortable dismissing the perspectives of marginalized peoples. As technology advances us toward a more global and interdependent future, social trends indicate many communities' reluctance to expanding their boundaries. A byproduct of the technological age is the more fast-paced, superficial nature of interpersonal interactions. These types of interactions restrict the amount of care shown to a person because conveying one's understanding of another's circumstance takes time. The most uncomfortable and time-consuming action is to find our similarities in others and humanize them in our eyes. The accompanying weight of that action can alarm people, but it will spur people to react to the injustices that surround them."
"This past spring, I read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ""Americanah."" I related to its protagonist's observations on the current complexities of race, gender, and perceived cultural identity in America, but I especially loved that the tone shift of her blog - from an assumed objectivity of Blackness in America to a more personal perspective - mirrored her relationship to race in the United States. In the United States, she grew to recognize race as a piece of her identity in ways previously unnecessary and unconsidered by her in Nigeria. I also noticed that when the main character, Ifemelu, took an unbothered approach to her blog, she was most comfortable in her writing. It wasn't until she began to share some of the experiences faced by Black Americans that she expanded her platform and attempted to change some of the public misconceptions of different groups of Black peoples in America."
"I have a problem: I think too much. I know, it sounds like a personal problem, right? But it's true; I can't stop thinking. I love to make up stories; and not only make up stories, but live out stories in my mind. I have done so for as long as I can remember and that's my problem: sometimes the creative impulses take over and there is nothing I can do to stop them. I started by merely making up my own character for my favorite books or movies. I inserted myself into the plot and I lived out those movies, the extended version written by me. My backyard became my world and I spent hours running around in it, imagining my character's life through every struggle, every highlight, every near death experience. I saw myself the way I imagined I would be in each scenario. The whole thing rolled out before me as if I was living through a movie in my mind. I was experiencing two lives, one in my imagination and the other in the reality of my everyday school life. Then I moved across the country. I decided that I was too old to be making up stories and running around in the backyard so I stopped. I gave up my fantasy world and started living a single life. My problem was solved. I started focusing on reality and I stopped thinking so much. But I never completely stopped. Years passed and I missed my stories. I still thought up stories, stories of my own creation by that point, but didn't let it consume my time. It was the summer going into my sophomore year and I remember walking along the beach with my best friend. It was dark out and the sky was full of stars. I remember sitting against an old piece of driftwood washed up by some past wave. There was a chill in the summer wind coming off the sea and I felt like talking. I hadn't seen him since I moved. We began catching up and I told him about my love for making up stories. I told him about one that I had developed particularly well. He told me to write it down. I did. I put my thoughts on paper, releasing my pent up world into the realm of a computer screen. I spent my entire Christmas break curled up in a blanket on the couch, in front of a fire, typing. I finished. But the stories didn't stop. I am now in the final stages of editing my first book with the hope of publishing it in the near future. Then I think I will move on to the sequel. After that, who knows? I will not shut off the creative side of my brain anymore. If I have an idea I jot it down and hope that one day I will get to expand on it. So, yes, I have a problem: I am creative, I love the worlds of my own fantasy but I have learned how to handle that and it's a problem that I am glad to have."
"I grew up the daughter of a cultured theater enthusiast and avid novel reader, both traits have been passed down to me, and as such it is hard to choose a favorite work. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be The Narnia series by C.S. Lewis, because it is to this series that I give credit for igniting my coherent imagination. The world of Narnia gave my imagination a setting in which to thrive. I paced around my childhood backyard for hours, the whole time lost in a world of my imagination, adding on to the Narnia story some days and creating stories of my own on others. My mental time spent in the land of Narnia gave me the inspiration to write and primed my brain for the task of creating my own literary world to put to paper."
"I enjoy learning so it doesn't take much to motivate me to do so. Understanding how and why things work, going deeper than the mere fact that something is, fascinates me. I want to know why people do what they do and I want to gain a deeper understanding of how people function. I am interested in how the world works and how it is changing. I am intrigued by art and literature and how it so uniquely expresses the human condition. Many people suffer from lack of knowledge and I believe the better understanding I can get of what the world was, mistakes that have been made, and what the world has become, the better equipped I will be as a responsible young person and part of this world's future."
"The internet has many gems like Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, etc. However, for every gem, there are over 100 sites that are more or less useless. That's why Mom's e-mail looked like just another e-mail with another link to another website. But that was wrong. When I clicked the link, I had no idea what I was getting into. At first the website looked like just another camp. Because I'm often content to homeschool through the summer, I didn't think this camp would be worth it at first. It was about a camp in that was going to be held in Seattle, Washington; but that is not why I changed my mind. It had field trip and activities and the like, but that still was not why I wanted to go. The reason I was excited to go can be found in the name of the camp its self. Its name was MATHcamp. Now many would be repulsed by such a name and I don't blame them. I was skeptical about the name, too, because the math has two different flavors of meaning. Unless you're a Mathematician, it is difficult to distinguish between them. Firstly, there is the traditional math, which is the kind that is taught in schools. It teaches how to solve simple problems. It teaches rote memorization. While this math is useful, it leaves you feeling dry. I prefer to call this type of mathematics, arithmetic. Alternatively, there is the less traditional math, which is the kind that is encouraged in college. It teaches how to solve elaborate problems. It teaches ingenuity. This math is not only useful, but also engaging. To me, this is true mathematics. If Mathcamp was the former, It would not have been appealing. Thankfully, it was discovered to be the latter through A piece of the application called the qualifying quiz. The qualifying quiz is basically a collection of mathematical puzzles. The staff at Mathcamp used these puzzles to find out if someone could handle Mathcamp. However, the quiz served me as more of a introduction to what Mathcamp would be like. After seeing what it was like, I just wanted more of this Mathcamp. So, I started working hard on the application. When the highly anticipated posting of the 2015 qualifying quiz finally arrived, I spent hours upon hours on the problems. Even though I am normally mellow, I was hyped. Eventually, my application was submitted. Then, around a month later, an e-mail arrived. But there was no celebration. They had deferred me to the second and last admission cycle. As can be imagined, that was disappointing. However, from an early age, I've made it a point to take whatever life gives. So, I started reworking my application when an e-mail from Mathcamp arrived. Mathcamp wanted to interview me through Skype, since I was homeschooled. Maybe I was reading too much into this, but it was a relief that my admission might have been delayed solely because of a technicality. But I was still anxious about the interview. Detailing the interview would be more tedious than enlightening, so let's just say that it was a decent interview. After the interview came a long and nerve-wrecking wait. Another month later, the e-mail came. Acceptance or Rejection? I was half afraid to open the e-mail. It was the former!"
"College will be a chance to fine tune my mathematics and to discover other fields. Math has been that one topic that I always come back to. I love its low barrier to entry, the irrefutability of its conclusions, and its epiphanies. But it can be very hard to figure out what to learn in mathematics At Mathcamp 2015 and 2016, I got the guidance I needed. Sadly, they were each only five weeks long. I look forward to studying this hard in college with my professors. But math isn't the only thing I've dived into. I love: Game design (creating engaging games), Linguistics (how language works), Science (how the world works), and Critical analysis (the deconstruction of works). This isn't an exhaustive list, but they all have to do with analyzing different subjects. College is an excellent opportunity to expand this list by learning new topics to analyze."
My favorite book is Alice in Wonderland. The book has a wonderful contrast between Alice's logic and the world's lunacy. Bonus points for the author being a mathematician. (I love math.)
"""And please welcome our Set Manger, Rick Lin!"" The claps echoed as the host announced my name to welcome the next director on stage. At that moment, I froze at the side of stage, sweating over my back. I stood behind the curtain, happy yet nervous, doubting reality- I did it! Among all the classes in my junior year, Stage Art, in which students collaborate and create sets for the annual musical play, was the only class that I chose for a second time. Different from other classes, which only served to fulfill credits, Stage Art was chosen not because I failed it last year, but because I have gained passion for it. Throughout my nine years of student life, the letter ""A"" and the number ""100"" were my only goals. Stage Art, however, was beyond a letter or a number-it was a rewarding experience, a remarkable achievement, and it taught me the power of following my passion. Given the idea that a student ought to learn subjects that lead to great careers, the concept of choosing the class that I was passionate about confused me. As I transferred to PAS, I, knowing nothing in regards to art, had one thing left to do- research and participate. Fortunately, my attitude drew the set manager's attention. He made me his assistant, letting me participate in management-related works. Every night, I had meetings with my manager, along with other directors, to discuss details of the play, such as scheduling rehearsals, going through the preparation lists, and reviewing the mistakes we encountered. My copy of the script was nearly torn apart from constant use. I sat in front of a desk, reading my script and stage notes, and listening to my roommates' annoying snores, as I realized the sun was rising. As I dedicated myself more and more to musical theater, the grades that I was once extremely proud of started to be less perfect. The letters were no longer ""A's""; ""B's started to appear in the grade book as well, resulting in criticism from my teachers, who tried to persuade me to quit the school musical and spend all my time studying in the library as I had always done before. But there was one thing that the grade book could not quantify: the satisfaction from musical that came along the way. Sadly to know, it was the first time that I was accomplishing something magnificent. I felt ashamed when I was yelled at by my manager when I did something wrong, yet I felt accomplished when I learned the right way to do it as well; I had no confidence in the props I made for the actors, yet the appreciation in their eyes that recognized my work motivated me to continue; I was mad at the mistakes that we had on production day, yet all the compliments from the audience embraced me with happiness. The third year of high school, which was my second year in musical, my first year of being the set manager, and the first time I stepped onto the stage as a leader, I was thrilled to know how happy I felt to do something I was passionate about. As I bathed in the luxurious lights above and reveled in the applause from the audience, I was amazed by the view I saw: the proud smiles on my friends' faces for the great job I'd done; the recognition in my teachers' eyes for how much the show meant to me; the tears rolling down my parents' faces for the heights I'd achieved. Although my transcript is no longer filled with ""A's,"" I understand how satisfying it is to feel passion for a project. Numbers and letters are impermanent, but the triumphant feeling of achievement through embracing my passion endures and accompanies me forever."
"Challenges result from transformations and ultimately lead to evolutions. Given the numerous technological transformations developed over recent decades, people are bathing in the technology's conveniences, such as the internet and digital transmissions. There are, however, communities taking advantage of so called ""dependable innovations."" I admire the revolutionary impact computer science brings upon society, yet the attendant risks are extremely dangerous. If technology holds the key to everything, a misuse of technology could destroy everything. It is worrisome enough that hackers and governmental institutions freely give themselves access to people's digital information; it is equally alarming that because technology as a container holds such a vast amount of information, the world could effectively collapse if a widespread technological glitch appears. In order to prevent such a crisis, cyber security should be significantly developed, and society should realize and address the imperfections of technology."
"My motivations are as various as the facets of my personality. As a student, I wish to pursue an excellent degree, thus my motivation is good grades; as a son, I wish to reciprocate my parents for their efforts with material luxuries, thus my motivation is money; as a boy, I wish to defeat others, thus my motivation is my opponents. However, the most crucial motivation for me, as an individual in society, is the opportunity to enrich myself in anyway I can. Since we are surrounded by uncertainties, any knowledge could be useful someday. With unlimited knowledge in the world, there can never be an end to the path of learning. A moving object only stops when it fails to conquer an obstacle or when it reaches its destination. As an unstoppable young man on the path towards his future, I intend to grab as much knowledge as possible."
"Click. This sound has expanded the scope of my world. A long period of time before this 1/60 second of sound, I had always immersed in my own world avoiding each kind of interactions. There was always an illusory cage restricting my thoughts. Every time people asked for my opinion, I had no way to articulate my opinion because of my scattered perspectives and the absence of confidence. Today, because of a seemingly small hobby, I am morphed into a different person. I got involved with photography from an encounter with my friend's shooting of a video for video editing class at a beach nearby out of my curiosity. During the process, I could not stop staring at him shooting the video and taking pictures. His every action on the camera captured my eyes. Each of the photos he showed me resembled a wonderful creation, an artwork that projected the creativity inside him. I was overwhelmed by the way he adjusted the value of saturation, contrast, and vintage. The golden sunlight in the photo exuded from the horizon; the sea glowed because of the sun at the background. In that moment, my lips bear a semblance of smile. My desire to convey my astonishment bursted out. This time, I found my language. He showed me his camera another time we went out for dinner and it was the first time I touched the intricate device. When I pressed the button, click, the sound lingered in my mind and my affection of photography sprouts. As soon as I got home, I tried to tell my parents about it, eagerly expressing my combined exhilaration and interest in photography but neither of them took my words seriously, thinking I was only following a fad. However the sound kept lingering in my mind; therefore I decided to start exploring my perspectives of photography by taking pictures with my phone camera, although with limited functions. I was always so attracted to the pictures I took from numerous angles which made me even more devoted to the scope of my world. As I reviewed these photos, fragments of my personality casually appeared from the faint blurs. I still remember an experience that I walked up a small hill where several electrical towers were located. It was my first time staying that close to those towers. I intuitively walked closer to the hill and picked up my camera without any hesitation. Raising up my head to observe as I always did, I eagerly captured what I saw by adjusting the ISO and the shutter speed, which I could still remember clearly, 200 and 1/640. After I walked out that hazardous area, I desperately looked down to the photo. I was amazed. The enormous geometric shapes staggered around the perfect contour of the symmetrical tower, and the white clouds randomly ornamented the white sky at the background. I found myself in that 1/640 second. I suddenly realized that every photo I had taken pulled me back to the outset of my catalyst that reminded me of my motivation and my persona. Taking photos accomplishes me, feeling like a part of something greater. Click, with this sound, my whole perception of the world changes. My confidence grows as I give suggestions to my friends to understand better of the perspectives in photography. The moments while I coached my friends help me finally acknowledge that I am capable of advising and teaching others by expressing who I am. Through my photo collection on the beauty of architecture, the reality of the society, and the vividness of the nature, photography develops into my language to communicate with my world. As my collection accumulates, the pieces of characteristics dispersed inside me begin to come in order. I eventually completed a baffled puzzle-myself. Photography becomes the precious lens in which I capture the heartbeat of the world and appreciate that splendid puzzle."
"During an entrepreneurship program in high school, I wanted to figure out how to finance higher education in Taiwan through equity, rather than debt. The innumerable statistical calculations and data regarding what could happen after the initial investment became evident. Instead of feeling faintness, I was drawn in by applying foundational knowledge to practical applications. In Emory College of Arts and Sciences, the abundance research opportunities in the major of Applied Mathematics and Statistics significantly appeal to me. Specifically, several research projects, such as Databases and Information Management, integrate the curriculum of mathematics and computer science and apply them to different areas of study. With distinguishing liberal art studies, I will become a versatile person as I seize the advantages. Here, Emory's education will become a tool for me to absorb knowledge and skills; practical experience becomes a platform for me to experience the knowledge that I will learn."
"My transfer to an American school altered my perspectives. With a wide range of classes that I took, I fell in love with photography. My photos started to reflect my understanding of different subjects. The severity of social issues that are discussed in class occur in my eyes as I capture them by my lens; in art class, the beauties of architecture are engraved in my head as I found my way of appreciating them through taking pictures. I become obsessed with the experience that I feel from my surroundings. Even if I only have limited chances of feeling these beauties, I grasp what I can get. I have thrown away the plain, aimless, and tedious ways of learning before I got to this American school. The opportunities for me to experience the vividness of the world motivates me to learn, or even, to press the shutter of my camera."
"I stood victoriously on the podium as I finished my speech to convince the house to vote in favor of China on the amendment. I knew I had delivered the speech of my life. However my illusion of grandeur was short lived. A delegate immediately stood up, raised his placard and haughtily asked: ""Why does the delegate believe that he has the right to talk about human rights issues when his country, China, persecutes Falun Gong?"" I stuttered. As I spotted other delegates rolling their eyes, I knew my speech would fail to persuade the house and, sure enough, the house overwhelmingly supported the amendment with a supermajority. I had done almost everything I could to prevent such a scenario: researching, making notecards and crafting my arguments. Didn't I do everything I could to avoid this? After I had regained composure, I tried to think about my failure from a different angle to alleviate my pain. I realized the culprit was doing all the research through my perspective, without accounting for my biases. During a break, I mustered my courage and approached the delegate to inquire about the intentions behind his interrogation. Surprisingly, he did not purposefully ask the question to give me a hard time, as people typically do towards China's delegation in Model UN. Instead, he wanted to clarify China's legislative progresses when considering human rights issues. China has made multiple questionable decisions regarding human rights issues. According to Human Rights Watch, China has repeatedly silenced dissidents and human rights activists on the grounds of ""unlawful congregation"" or ""disturbance of social order."" The National People's Congress also passed Article 300 in Criminal Law to persecute ethnic minorities and cults; these labels are, of course, open to legal interpretation. If I could re-do the speech, I would acknowledge China's track record on human rights before my opponents could use it against me. I would have given the example of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress's abolition of the Re-Education through Labor Program; the decision was made because the program was ineffective, but more importantly because it violated fundamental human rights. My speech would have been much more effective if I had considered my arguments from multiple perspectives, or challenged myself with counter-arguments. That was the moment when I realized I was blinded by my ego. In retrospect, I should be grateful for those who questioned or challenged me. Their criticism, whether constructive or negative, helped me grow. In the past, I couldn't tolerate loosing or feeling inferior, and would let my ego cloud my judgment and ability to think critically. As I slowly learned to consider different perspectives, I overcame my ego as well. Now, in discussions, when confronted with opinions that differ from my own, I would judge the opponent's arguments based on their logic and information instead of my feelings toward the subject. I actively remind myself to consider different perspectives, and that personal biases are detrimental to productive, objective discussions as well as personal growth."
"Lonely death, a growing social phenomenon where elders who live alone in a house and die unnoticed, is macabre as it is alarming, and affects east Asian countries the most. According to a report released by Kim Choon-Jin, Chairman of the Health and Welfare Committee in South Korea, there were 1,245 cases of lonely deaths last year in South Korea. Likewise, the situation is so severe that Hidenori Sakanaka, Executive Director at the Japan Immigration Policy Institute, acknowledged that, ""what the government is doing is not going to address the serious population collapse that Japan faces."" While it is important to recognize the need for advanced senior care technology, I think the real challenge is restoring human connections in an age of hyper virtual connectedness and real-life social isolation."
"Many people describe college as a journey to self-discovery and growth, and say that the people you meet and the things you do and learn during this period of time will define you. This journey is what I am most excited about. My self-knowledge and identity as a Taiwanese is politically and culturally charged because of Taiwan's history and shared heritage with China. The Sunflower Student Movement-a civil disobedience protest a legislation that liberalizes trade between Taiwan and China-highlights this tension. People argued over who truly represents Taiwanese interest and what constitutes a Taiwanese identity. I participated in the movement as an observer and left with more questions than answers, yet this experience made me very excited about the prospect of finding an answer through my college adventures. Ultimately, I hope I can answer the question: ""Who truly represents Taiwan?"""
"Anne Frank said ""In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart."" She stood out in a time when the world was consumed with hate and vengeance for one another. Despite all the horrors and terrors of the Holocaust, she chose to believe that there was still hope in humanity. We may not have faced the same degree of adversity, but we share the same heart because I also believe that humanity contains more hope than despair. I had a friend who suffered emotional and physical disabilities. When everyone else alienated him, I showed kindness and lent him a helping hand. On May 26th of this year, he suddenly lost control and punched me very hard in the right eye. I suffered indescribable pain. The doctor could not offer ""effective"" medicine because the punch had caused permanent damage. Whenever I opened my eyes, I saw blurs, flashes of black and white lightning, and flies buzzing. In my helplessness, I even wanted to give up on school altogether. After months of lingering hope, I went back to the hospital only to hear tragic news. The doctor informed me that both my right and left eyes appeared elliptical, meaning that my retinas would certainly detach. It was just a matter of time, one no doctor could predict. I started to imagine a new world of darkness. When I returned to school blindfolded, my classmates couldn't forgive my friend. ""Why don't you sue him?"" ""Why not send him to jail?"" ""I hate him! Don't you?"" After seeing the quote, my response changed and has been the same ever since, ""No, I empathize with him."" While I focused on recovery, I could not keep up with my school assignments, finals, projects, and SAT preparation. Fear ensued because the fear of losing my physical vision built up upon my worries of not being able to handle any academics at all. At that point, I felt so helpless and empty that I wanted to give up on school altogether. The turning point came when I heard God's words from the Bible that really comforted my heart and soul. Since then, I trusted in God solely and let myself rest. As my condition started to improve slightly over time, I learned how to manage my tasks and how to expend my energy, so my eyes could receive the maximum time needed to rest. I redeemed most of my time by staying away from electronics, iPads, and video games. I read printed books more frequently rather than digital texts. I started to regain what I had lost, and I was picking up the pieces of myself. I grew in faith but also in character. After I connected with people's sufferings, I started to understand the economy of life. I learned compassion and empathy. I grasped deeper insights about life than I would have been able to if this accident had not occurred. By showing compassion, and love towards others who struggle, I will make the world a better place. By staying positive and not giving in to self pity, I will show others the light that shines in us will continue no matter what darkness. I understand that, though I may lose my physical vision one day, I will not have lost my vision for my life. Even if I lose my physical vision, the rest of my body will still be healthy and young, and help to fulfill my internal vision. I have always performed charity works in the community, and I will be able to pursue them even if I should go blind. For now, I may be enduring the shorter end of life's stick, but by standing back up, I have already conquered the worst. And it is my vision for life that truly defines who I am. What was once deemed a curse is now perhaps my greatest advantage."
"In the novel To Kill A Mockingbird, author Harper Lee reveals a story in which prejudice takes centerstage. Lee's novel changed the way a generations of readers understood racism and prejudice. Although the people Harper Lee portrays are black, their experience in the past seems to correlate with me as an Asian today. But the characters have taught me that, despite any possible discrimination, I should always be courageous enough to stand up to any unequal treatment. I also empathize with Tom Robinson, who seems so innocent but is exploited and killed at the end. I experienced a similar situation in May, when my ill-tempered classmate lost control and punched me very hard in the eye. Tom reminds me to show the courage to fight for rights and to bravely move on with life despite all obstacles. He has been my role model ever since."
"My father has been an indelible motivation for me to learn. He takes care of his mother, who previously abandoned him, and my grandfather who has been in a vegetative state since 1982. Though he is clearly exhausted, he never complains. Since childhood, I have volunteered at various charity foundations, hospitals, and schools for the disabled. I find my purpose of living in the happiness of others. I feel intrinsically motivated to learn and succeed within school and outside school because I understand achieving academically signifies receiving the education needed to become a medical professional. What my father has accomplished and achieved as a doctor motivates me to learn because I want to become like him: someone who can constantly contribute to the society. He inspires me to be open and accepting towards others. To do so requires constant learning, a kind of learning that breeds empathy."
"The plain-colored floor was embellished with blue and red squares, and the initially white walls had been decorated with countless colorful posters, yet all was monochrome to me. As I entered the unfamiliar classroom, my eyes searched desperately for some familiar faces, hoping to see someone of my same background. Much to my dismay, I noticed only people who were seemingly different from me, sitting with their own friends and peering at me. Fearing that they would just reply coldly, I found a seat in the corner and sat down in desolation. Memories from the evening when my parents told me that we were moving began to flash back in my head. ""We are moving,"" they said casually, as if it was a practical joke. The next day, numerous cardboard boxes sat around the living room, waiting to be filled up. I stared in disbelief. ""I didn't get to say goodbye to my friends,"" I realized, ""What happened to my say in this? How can mom and dad be so selfish! I wasn't planning to meet new people and I don't want to!"" Anger was rising inside of me. My hand rolled into a fist, tempted to punch the next thing I see. That overwhelming feeling returned now as I was surrounded by a roomful of strangers. As I timidly looked around the room, I noticed a girl with medium-length black hair, pale skin, and rosy pink cheeks looking at me. We made quick eye-contact; I smiled, and she immediately smiled back. At that moment, my anxiety and fury suddenly abated tremendously, and my heart warmed because that smile had been so welcoming. I decided that I was going to approach her and introduce myself instead of waiting for others to come around and greet me. ""Hi..."" I said in a trembling voice, but avoided eye contact with her. ""Hi!"" she replied, ""I'm Vanessa and I'm from Mexico. It is so nice to have you join our class! These are my friends!"" She waved her arm toward a group of people. I expected alienating stares due to my distinctiveness from them, but instead, they smiled so heartwarmingly at me that any negative feelings that had been lingering in my mind disappeared. There was a sudden influx of all kinds of questions, asking about my background to interests and preferences. I began to ask some questions myself, and they answered unreservedly. Seeing others so unafraid to ask and answer questions, I had the sudden urge to know them and their cultural backgrounds better, and the confidence to open myself up. Despite the dynamic nature of the school, I was ever since inspired by Vanessa to be opened to various new experiences and people. Whenever I am put with a roomful of stranger, it is the memory of her unfading smile that boosts my confidence to initiate a conversation with others. Bonding and interacting with other people, especially with those from all over the world, have become such an important part of me, that I yearn to visit their countries one day to further expand my global perspectives. I am extremely grateful for the decision my parents made seven years ago because without this change, I would just be that quiet girl sitting in the corner of the classroom and engulfed by only one single culture. Now that I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone, I am no longer afraid to face and new experiences and challenges."
"The term ""indie folk"" used to direct me towards folk music, which I thought of as something outdated and distant from my generation. The melodies' slow tempos, the vocalists' rough voices, and the use of instruments had never caught my attention, until I stumble upon an Icelandic band, Of Monsters and Men. The female vocalist's crystal clear voice harmonized with the strummings of acoustic guitars, the beatings of percussions, and the sounds of trumpets, trombones, and accordions. This slow yet melodious piece resonated in my head and soothed the byproduct of a hectic life-my restless body. As I explore the rest of their album, My Head is an Animal, I found myself being taken through a portal into a world of tranquility and carefreeness, without even having to leave where I was. This album has become my ultimate getaway from the chaotic reality."
"Emory University, known for its diverse yet closely-knit community, is my ideal college campus and academic environment. Sharing facilities with graduate and professional schools provides me the proximity to both well-renowned faculty members and experienced students, whom I could ask for advices on study options and future career paths. Goizueta Business School's junior year admission model particularly caught my attention as it would not only fulfill my desire to study business but also give me sufficient amount of time to explore a wide range of interdisciplinary offerings at the university. Located in Atlanta, the business center of the Southeast, Emory is beneficial to practical learners like me as I could gain innumerable hands-on experiences and chances to interact with industry professionals, which would enrich my understanding in how business operates in corporate settings. I believe I could get a well-rounded education from the theoretical and practical curriculum at Emory."
"It was there when I saw it, lying on the floor, its abdomen exposed like a dead fish. Thoughts racing chaotically and heart throbbing, I quickly paced until coming to a stop beside the rectangular, dark torso. I knelt down to inspect each compartment, searching for any scratches. I was relieved when I finally saw that my violin had remained intact despite the freefall from the top of my locker. The locker. Then something clicked: I knew exactly who had thrown my violin to the ground. As the student life officer, she should have informed students about the school-wide sanitization. As a senior staff, she should have refrained from such insensitive actions. With each fleeting thought, my blood boiled and my fists clenched. In my life, rarely have I been driven to a point where my emotions got the better of me. For me, avoiding conflict is paramount, so I have the habit of suppressing my feelings and opinions when disagreements arise. This time, however, I had to get an apology as well as an assurance of my instrument's safety in the future. That night, when I told my parents about the episode, they fully supported my decision to let the staff member know how I felt and encouraged me to write her a letter. I had one mission - justice for my companion of seven years. On my desk, the charcoal lead clashed against the harsh white, forging an accusation against her. Believing that I had written a letter that effectively addressed the issue, I recited the draft to my parents. ""How can you possibly treat such a delicate instrument so brutally?"" ""Why did you not warn us before committing the atrocity?"" As I uttered the coarse expressions, I felt uneasy, yet they listened earnestly until the last sentence. ""You did a great job clarifying the entire incident, and you also presented a clear stance in your letter,"" my dad said, reassuringly. ""However, I want you to imagine yourself in her position. How would you react to these unfriendly sentences?"" The question reverberated in my mind. I was bereft of an answer against this simple query. As I sought to respond to this question in my second endeavor, instead of guilt-tripping her, I described my feelings: ""I was deeply upset when I saw my instrument fallen on the ground that Tuesday."" Rather than accusing her of negligent actions, I proposed the means to prevent a recurrence: ""In the future, I would greatly appreciate a notification before you move my instrument so that I could do so myself and save you the trouble of relocating it."" The next day, I left the envelope on her desk. For three days, there was no reply in any form. One morning, as I was walking down the hallway, I spotted her walking toward me. Heartbeats accelerated, I began to doubt if my letter had conveyed a message that was respectful enough. I feared that a single word might have sabotaged our relationship. I wanted to bury my head in the sand. But I took a deep breath and mustered just enough courage to approach her. ""Oh, hi, Michael!"" She sounded surprisingly casual and cordial. The internal tension immediately relaxing, I smiled back and greeted her. ""About your violin, I would like to apologize for the horrible experience,"" she said. ""You don't have to worry about the safety of your violin anymore. I assure you!"" Her voice blurred into the background. I was triumphant. It was a victory built upon a connection rather than upon a divisive confrontation. Out of the experience, I gained a new mindset. As someone who had always maintained peace by not voicing my opinions, I had discovered a new balance where courteous words and thoughtful resolutions gave voice to my assertiveness. Now, I am my own master."
"On paper, the life expectancy in most countries is steadily rising, enabled by the ever-advancing field of modern medicine. Contrary to popular belief, however, young people now face a formidable adversity: chronic diseases are evident at younger ages than ever before, and unknown diseases are emerging rapidly. We turn to doctors and clinics for relief, but our modern reliance on medicines paradoxically correlates with a reduced quality of life. We're not living longer; we're dying longer. What is the culprit behind this phenomenon? Our highly industrialized societies immerse us in an assortment of environmental toxins: the shelves in every convenient store and supermarket contain foods saturated with sugars and preservatives. The constant consumption of these additives leads to autoimmune and chronic diseases, and directly breeds obesity and diabetes. We, as the upcoming generation, must educate others and ourselves of such troubling trends in order to combat this challenge."
"When I picked up When Breath Becomes Air, I was simply attracted to two words on the cover - neuroscience and surgeon. I did not expect to embark on an extraordinarily introspective journey in search of the meaning of life and death with Dr. Paul Kalanithi. On the verge of becoming a full professor in neurosurgery, Kalanithi is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The future he had imagined is obliterated, but, as he faces the valley of death, his unique position as both a knowledgeable doctor and a helpless patient helped further his endeavor to discover the purpose of his existence. Inspired by his potent drive to understand, I was compelled to ponder the rationale behind my own passion for neuroscience. His personal memoir has revealed to me that, as we seek to understand the complexity and vastness of our brains, we must face the fundamental questions about life itself."
"looked down at my full page of scribbled notes on economic plans for the issue in the committee. The delegate of Argentina was finishing up his speech. I had spent the entire week researching and preparing for the issue for the Model United Nations conference. I was ready to manifest my knowledge. Excitement and eagerness to show off myself controlled my mind, and I could not stop my hands from shaking. With sweaty palms and a loudly beating heart, I began to lift the ""Qatar"" placard. ""Delegate of Guatemala!"" the Chair called out. A few seconds elapsed before I realized that I had blown away my chance. In my rising senior year, I participated in an entrepreneurship program offered by a Wharton professor through our school. Eager to share, each member of my team came up with a proposal. I was undeterred by the final challenge of coming up with an innovative venture idea as I enjoy combining interdisciplinary research and world issues. Student loans have become a huge obstacle in promoting higher education, and I proposed a solution to challenge current loan and borrow system. Lack of confidence had always bothered me; being the silent partner in discussions has always been my weakness. Despite having the intention to show my effort, I invariably falter and hesitate. When time came to share my idea, I was in trepidation and doubted whether my teammates would be acceptable to the proposal. I was hesitant and agonized by the thought, and pressured under the assumption, that no-one would be in agreement with my idea. But at the same time, there was a little voice nagging inside my mind, ""You've spent so much time on this, are you going to give it all up again? What have you got to lose?"" My business plan means a lot to me. I had brainstormed on this idea for months. This is my dream and ambition. After long pondering, I took a deep breath and started explain the plan. Initially, my delivery was awkward but as I continued, I began to gain confidence. My team members listened patiently as I explained my idea. To ensure no misconception, I made sure to enunciate and lay out my plan clearly. The reaction from my audience was encouraging; they were engrossed with the idea, posed and brainstormed on challenging questions. While we came out of the discussion with many unanswered questions, we had a clear sense of direction. This was far different from the expectations that I had previously envisioned, and set for me a pleasant change of perspective. I felt appreciated, but at the same time, regretful and misgiving. I kicked myself for the times I missed out on opportunities to perform, not having the courage to stand up for what I want to achieve. I always managed risks carefully, disinclined to leave the boundaries of my comfort zone, as a result, missed out on many opportunities instantaneously. I questioned why I presumed that other people are better than myself, and didn't allow myself to have the benefit of a doubt? It wasn't that difficult, I discovered. That little growth in confidence boosted my morale tremendously. Throughout the rest of the project, we constructed a thoughtful and creative venture plan, and eventually won the third place of the final pitch contest. It was a truly amazing journey for me. Not only was I able to lead the team but this experience also enabled me to see the potential of my individual growth once I step out of my comfort zone. I am no longer the insecure and timid person, but feel comfortable with my ability and intellect to compete with others globally. This has made me realize that the only obstacle we have in life is ourselves, and that I can overcome the obstacle, only if I give myself a shot."
"The opportunity to participate in discussions motivates me to apply for American universities. I am a person who is deeply interested in the happenings of the global community and has many opinions on it. Although communities such as the internet and my school increase my understandings of the world and foster my interest in studying economics, they offer little chances for me to satiate my desire in discussing social issues with people. I believe Emory is the right place for me to join the intellectual conversation and absorb new ideas. As a patient listener and an enthusiastic speaker, I see myself moving forward with the participation in various seminars, clubs, and speeches in my college experience. With the academic freedom, I'm thrilled to be exposed in a wide range of perspectives. I am certain that my experience in Emory will expand my intellectual altitude and improve my speaking skills exponentially."
"Walter Block's Defending the Undefendable is my favorite non-fiction book. As the title states, the book intends to defend certain thought-to-be despicable people in our modern society. While many commentators criticize this book for challenging the common moral standards, the author has no intention to advocate the behaviors of the ""heroes"" he mentions in the book. Instead, Walter Block is trying to point out what law is just and what is not. ""Libertarianism"" is the core concept of the book. Through defending those reviled occupations from case to case, he ingeniously explains the libertarian views on social and economic issues. It is a moral shock to read the book. I constantly debate with my innerself about each case. Although I have diverging opinions regarding the argument made by Walter Block, I now consider myself a libertarian and wish to promote this ideology to make the world a better place."
"Flipping through my childhood album, I am drawn to a yellowed photograph with the rather ordinary image of a two-year-old playing legos. But this photo is anything but ordinary. In fact, it records a defining moment in my life. I flip over the photograph, and there, with faded blue ink, are my mom's words: ""3. 06. 2001. First time Mei-Mei wears glasses."" I was born with severe myopia - 1000 degrees in both eyes. I also have amblyopia, a disorder which cannot be reversed with prescription glasses. To me, the world consists of indefinite shapes and blended colors. The doctor told my mother I would never have normal vision, much less be able to read avidly or play musical instruments. As simply as that, the course of my life had been determined - or so it seemed. Amblyopia can be corrected with eye training, and so the hospital became my second home. Afternoons were dedicated to maze tracing, an exercise designed to train the eye to focus. Wearing eye patches became a daily ritual. My amblyopia eventually was corrected; however, my 1000-degree myopia remains to this day. Even at the age of five, I knew that I was the only one who could stop my condition from becoming a hindrance. I wanted desperately to play the piano and violin, so I convinced my mom to allow me to practice at 30-minute intervals interrupted by 5 minutes of rest. A proficient level of violin and piano requires at least two to three hours of practice daily; conversely, I needed to be exceptionally self-disciplined to protect my eyes from too much stress. Balancing the needed practice time with the required eye rest demanded patience and extraordinary perseverance. Practice, rest, practice, rest, practice, rest. This rhythm became ingrained into my daily schedule. My passion and persistence gradually nourished my ability and created a special place in my heart for both piano and violin. Music became not only a powerful medium to express my feelings, but also a dramatic reflection of the hurdles I would have to overcome in my life. Because of the extra effort that I put into musicianship, sharing my passion became immensely rewarding. When a friend of mine asked me to teach her violin in eighth grade, I quickly accepted her request. She wanted to master ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" but I insisted that she practice scales in order to build a strong foundation. Of course, my insistence was met with resistance. I then told her my story and explained how the mastery of any piece requires personal commitment. With a half-an-hour lesson every week, we first polished notes, then melodies, then full pieces. When she gave me a huge grin after playing ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flawlessly, I knew sharing the gift I possessed with others is what really makes all the years of endeavor worthwhile. Indeed, wearing thick-lensed glasses has become an inseparable part of my life that defines who I am. I always smile when others ask if I like to watch television or play video games. ""No, I was born like this,"" I answer. The determination to preserve my health continues: I set my bedtime curfew at ten, opt for video-calling instead of texting whenever I can, and increase my productivity when using the computer. Now, learning, especially reading and playing music, forms the center of my life. My disability has never hindered me from making progress, but rather, it has nourished my will and persistence to overcome challenges. My health condition has become a gift, a gift that has taught me that I am the author, the authority of my own life. Leveling my gaze at the photo, I smile inwardly. I know in the depth of my soul - and the tips of my fingers - that as long as I believe in myself, nothing can - or ever will - stop me."
"We live in an information age where an abundance of data is easily accessible and available. With this deluge of information, it is imperative that our generation recognize the rapidity of any transformation, whether it is technological, economical, or social ones. In the past decade, for example, we have seen Facebook replace MySpace, and smartphones replace flip phones. Similar to technology, individuals who do not adapt to this changing world will be superseded by others. During my high school career, two entrepreneurs inspired me to create Aquapology, a business that eliminates the need for pesticides and chemical fertilizers to grow food. I knew at that moment that our next generation leaders will be those who can accurately predict future trends and the demands of the people. Only be fully recognizing the opportunities and risks of these trends can our generation unlock the formidable capabilities of our age."
"Known for its brilliant cast and enticing plot, Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, first triggered my interest because of its flawless mix of character drama and thrilling mystery. Unlike others, I am neither attracted to Sherlock's superior intellect nor his ingenious deductive skills. Rather, I am engrossed with this series because of the hero's emotional transformation - from a heartless individual to a compassionate one. Despite being quick-minded and extraordinarily brilliant, which greatly appealed to the geeky side of me, this character initially revolts me because of his disinterest towards those around him. However, as his friendship with Watson deepens, Sherlock gradually sees the worth of sentiment, and becomes a loving and loyal friend. As an undergraduate planning to pursue medicine, Sherlock not only reminds me of the core values of being a doctor - kindness and compassion - but also the fact that these virtues will always trump knowledge."
"The gentle whooshing of the wind kissing my cheeks, the comfortable solitude, and an embrace with drug-like adrenaline are all how I feel when skiing. I was introduced to skiing when I was barely in elementary school and have loved it ever since. The mere thrill that bubbles up just from stepping into my boots is second-to-none. It is because of this love that I continually fantasize about snow all year long, and it is this sentiment that dragged and drew me out of bed early in the mornings when the winter sun was not even up. I always raced to get to the chairlift before anyone else. To me, I found skiing to be a rendezvous between my primal lust for recklessness and my more lucid rational half. Whether it be the sensation of flying down a powdery white slope at thirty miles per hour, feeling completely in control amidst the chaos and blurring trees or the anxiety pumping through my veins while nailing a C-rail, the jittery goosebumps and excitement I was left with was incomparable to anything else. However, despite the elevating excitement I felt, I still remember vividly the bruises sustained from my constant falling and tripping when I first started and how, over the course of the first three days, I remained stranded, stuck in ire, while all my friends dramatically improved. I later realized this was due to my signature stubbornness and my reluctance to communicate for improvement. I naively thought I had understood the instructions perfectly when the coach explained to me how to spread the skis into a wedge, like the shape of a pizza, without knowing that I actually had to put pressure down to brake. Even after encountering many difficulties and frustrations throughout practices, I gave no regard to this essential instruction and thus had paid for it with repeated pain and annoyance. It was only later on when a good Samaritan in the group, who spoke fluently and saw my problems and tried to explain to me my faulty technique, that I understood my errors in skiing. With his assistance, I started to improve my skills in later practices. Since childhood, obstinacy in my own point-of-view seemed to have become an obvious trait of my personality. From my failed skiing experience, I thus realized the benefits of taking other's feedback, which also taught me how to accept and listen to others and their perspectives. By my teenage years, my induction into the world of politics via Model United Nations further molded me into a person who not only followed my heart and insisted on exacting my points and arguments with vigor, but also someone able to open up to others and seek out their opinions. During lobbying, I had to deal with problems and reach a resolution by seeking alliances with others, from which I have learned to balance between pushing hard by staying firm with my perspectives and becoming lenient when considering others' stances. I have thereby learned not to fall out by combining my point of view with others' contributions. The numerous lobbying experiences in my high school MUN involvement continued to nurture that mindset and further convinced me to develop my own perspectives, bringing out my own voice but all the while staying flexible. In all fairness, my stubbornness never really did vanish. Through MUN, however, it morphed, granting me the persistence and fearlessness to assert myself as much as being in check and listening. I am a blend of these two experiences: enabling and allowing me to become relentlessly dogged in pursuit of realizing my goals and conveying my perspectives while being able to function as a team player. After all, it was this teamwork in MUN that was crucial to crafting alliances, passing resolutions, and constructing blocs to get matters done, the same cores, I believe, are needed for success in the real world."
"I seek an environment where I can explore not only a variety of fields but also participate in student organizations that align with my passions. Particularly, I am drawn to Emory's MUNE and Washington Semester with its research emphasis. Joining Emory's seasoned MUN team allows me to hone my debate and lobbying skills. Conversely, through being a student officer, I hope to be able to contribute elements from my own high school MUN career. Ultimately, I aspire for MUNE to supplement my journey into politics. As for my goal to uncover aspects of problem solving in a multifaceted fashion, the Washington Semester and research project further complement it by equipping me with opportunities to enhance the research skills needed for the professional field. Armed with these opportunities, I am convinced Emory will best satisfy my hope to understand world issues in a holistic manner, further adding to my spectrum."
"Before 8th grade, my political perspectives were linked to Taiwan, abiding by a black-and-white narrative of strictly KMT or DPP. Such shortsighted mindset, in retrospect, had suffocated my ability to witness the diverse realm of the political landscape. As I entered Model United Nations, my worldview cracked from black-and-white to shades of grey. The dynamic issues I became exposed to in conjunction with courses from histories to economics not only made it impossible for me to deny issues as complex and layered but imparted a realization that a multidisciplinary approach was essential to truly understanding this giant, interconnected web. Following this awareness, I have begun to engage in classes with a renewed vigor, driven by the need and confidence that these additional facets will prove valuable in time, granting additional angles beyond the spectrum I presently see."
"My ears burning red and my heartbeat accelerating, I stumbled up to the podium. Blood rushed to my brain as I swept up the microphone. ""The map demonstrates the... the..."" I stuttered. Nothing but silence followed. At that very moment, time stopped. The audience stared intently at me, like a pack of hyenas tracking its prey. The world around me started to spin out of control. I grasped the podium for support, knowing I had to continue, but I couldn't think of anything to say. My mind was overwhelmed by the chaos that surrounded me. I felt miniscule, insignificant, and helpless. This crippling fear is what I felt every time I stood in front of a crowd and even a group of friends. For as long as I could remember, the fear of speaking had plagued me. I had attempted to suppress my fear with sheer will, but the fear always ended up shattering me. Day after day, I was drawn deeper and deeper into the dark abyss of fear with no sign of return. I backed away from any social life and engrossed myself in the solitary world of video games. It wasn't until I moved to Texas my freshmen year of high school that I learned how to overcome my dread of speaking. American students, particularly Texans, are very different than Taiwanese students. In short, unlike my humble, self-effacing Taiwanese friends, my peers in Texas were overflowing with confidence. No matter what background, no matter how great or how little their talent, from the high-achieving, national debate champions to the goof-off students with bad grades and worse behavioral records, American students talked with unbounded confidence. An idea came to me one day when I saw a student stride into class late and proceed to make a five-minute impromptu speech on why he should be excused. With no fear of authority and a complete disregard of the judgment of his teacher or his classmates, the student eloquently defended his defenseless lateness. I realized at that instance that my fear of speaking was actually a fear of being judged. ""What's there to be afraid of?"" I wondered. ""Nothing,"" I answered with new confidence. I can't say I changed overnight, but I have transformed myself from someone who was always timid in public to someone who has claimed his voice. When I represented Taiwan in the International Environmental Leadership Conference in HaKfar HaYarok, I stepped up to the podium, closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and proceeded to project my voice. ""Hello fellow delegates,"" I declared. ""We represent Taiwan in this conference and we are here to discuss some possible solutions to climate change."" The speech rolled off my tongue quite naturally, and the presentation ended with thundering applause. Some audience members disagreed with me. However, instead of feeling cowed by their disapproval, the discussion we shared turned out to be a rewarding experience. Through our open disagreement, we gained a mutual understanding and eventual consensus that lead to innovative ideas. This experience taught me the importance of judgment, argument, and compromise in order to reach new levels of thought. I will bring this spirit of active engagement to the university. With my reclaimed voice, I am ready to take on the challenges and judgments brought forth by the intellects of higher education. True intellectual investigation is not one-sided, but rather an exchange of insights. Because I have lived in two different cultures, I can bring the best of two worlds to the table-American confidence coupled with Taiwanese humility. Together, they form a winning method for academic growth."
"The challenge for the next 50 years is to accommodate the increased energy demand while lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The world still relies on coal, which correlates to the increase of greenhouse gases. To make matters worse, people who deny the reality of climate change are gaining ground. Considering the current political tone, a sustainable future depends on an attractive alternative. I believe the technology that the world needs can be found in biology. Biofuels, produced from agricultural material, and biobatteries, powered by organic compounds, are two examples of renewable energy solutions. While fossil fuels harm the environment, these energy sources will not contribute to the increase in greenhouse gases. Solving the challenge in the next 50 years is crucial for the survival of the species, and I want to join the fight. My mission at Emory University is clear to me: learn everything and anything I can about biotechnology."
"There is only one motivation for learning, and that is power - the ability to control something, influence someone, or define one's self. Although it sounds rather dark, the idea is actually very positive: the want for power is a basic human instinct because power increases our ability to survive. Different people perceive power differently. Some believe that power comes from the ability to make friends, while others believe that power comes from knowledge; the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The ones who believe that power comes from knowledge are the ones who are motivated to learn, and I'm one of them. In particular, I want to explore the depths of the seemingly bottomless field of biology and computer science. As I dive deeper into the abyss of the subjects, I find the journey immensely satisfying because I enter a state of knowing. Because I know, I am empowered."
"""Seven more push-ups,"" my commander roared. I dropped down, trying to remember my mistakes. I fidgeted; I stepped out of line and was caught. During my semester in Israel, on the Eisendrath International Experience, I spent a week in the Gadna army program. This week had a great impact on my life. We were split into teams of ten, each group placed with an unflinching and tough-looking commander. For a week, we wore identical uniforms: belts, sneakers, berets, and tied back hair. I crawled across dirt and rock covered fields and slept in a tent. For meals, we received no more than bread and cans of tuna. Everything was a command. This was a bit of a problem for me, in that I am not always inclined to completely listen to others. Sometimes I feel I know better than others what is right, and want to do it. There were times when I was beyond frustrated. I no longer wanted to be part of this group. I craved freedom. On our third day, we took a ""masa,"" a journey. A seven mile run, silent and solemn. As a natural chatterbox, I found this task particularly difficult. Once we reached the top of the mountain, we were instructed to start sprinting for what felt like hours, until we were allowed to switch to army crawling, which was not much easier. Every day that week was a new challenge; step without making a sound, carry bags of sand, lead the group. I wanted to lie down in a warm blanket and sleep for days, but that was not a choice. The fourth day was field day. I woke up, nervous for what was to come. We did not play softball, soccer, or capture the flag. We painted our faces with mud. We ran from a 'grenade'. We walked without a sound, sprinted as fast as possible, and worked as a team. We finished the day, ready for dinner as our reward. We were not done. Apprehensive, we walked in two straight lines to the dining hall where we were informed of our new task. No food, shower, or sleep. We had to stay covered in mud, sweat, and a fair amount of blood, and clean up all the food and trash littered on the ground. An hour later, ready to collapse, we were sent to our small canvas tents. There we discovered that, due to our late arrival, the heaters and light bulbs were gone. It was the middle of February. The last day, my commander revealed herself to us. For a week, she had simply been ""Commander."" Now, she told us her name. She was Eti. She was nineteen, and she was nervous. As scared as I had been to start the week, I realized she was even more scared. Eti had never been a commander for Americans before. She employed the method- ""fake it til you make it"" quite effectively. Her confidence has inspired me to stand up straight, push harder, and finish all my push ups. I did not want to disappoint her. The last day of Gadna was the closing ceremony, and I received a medal: most improved. There never was a description of what it meant, and I still think that stands for being assigned the most push-ups for not following orders. For weeks after, I enjoyed comparing bruises and ""battle scars,"" bragging about who had the best commander, and reveling in the idea that I had been in the army. My experience showed me how resilient I am. I realized that although sometimes following orders is difficult, I can do it. If it had been what I had expected, I would not have appreciated it. If it had been fun, I would not remember it. If it had been easy, I would not have learned how strong I am."
"My ideal college environment is my current experience. I am in Tel Aviv, living with 13 other Gapniks: students on a gap year program. For the first time in my life, I live in an city and I love it. During the day, I have discussion based classes on politics, religion, philosophy and world history along with language immersion. I am rarely alone which I thrive on. Each night, I have the option to go out in the city, or to stay in my apartment with friends. We run events and cultural nights, where instead of absorbing the city's culture, we create our own entertainment. I love the opportunity to explore my unique surroundings with friends who I love and make me comfortable. I was excited to learn about the small classes and academic experience offered by Emory and the opportunity to explore the vibrant environment of Atlanta."
"My favorite book is ""The Night Circus"" by Erin Morganstern. It is written in a style of imaginative realism and fantasy with descriptions of childhood wonder and adult competition. Keeping the imagination and dreams of childhood while growing up is extremely difficult, but something I have tried to do. Naivety and innocence are beautiful and enhance quality of life, however, adult survival also requires a healthy sense of self-sufficiency. This book showed me that it is possible to have the best of both worlds. Reading it made me determined to keep my dreams alive, and to always follow them. I try to walk my own path, but not live exclusively in my own world, much like the main characters in the book, Celia and Marco. As I've matured, I have also learned that is important to think about others and the value of giving to society."
"""Son, I ask you to become a better man than me. Always protect your brother and grandmother"", I made a promise to my dying grandfather, five years ago. On this day, I felt like a complete failure. I failed my old man. I broke my vow. Daniel, my younger brother, was shot on the chest by a cattle rustler. He had always protected me. Sometimes, he sacrificed his own life for me. In a pool of blood lay the body of my soul mate, still and breathless. I refused to accept the reality. I hoped against hope that he would come back to life. ""Please forgive me brother"" I whispered. Two arrows in the chest had just killed my sibling. My grandmother's aspirations, the talented footballer and his dreams of becoming a lawyer were all gone. I have never forgotten the tears my family shed over his death. I was deeply affected, hurt and lost. Things would never be the same again. In this tragedy however, I found an inspiration; a motivation to change things. I knew that families in my community were suffering from cattle rustling. It's as though no one noticed. I wanted to act. I found the strength to love, heal, forgive, and change what was broken in my life. Progress would not be mandated nor photographed; instead, it would come as a result of simple acts. I was tired of cattle rustling in my area. My small village surely needed liberation from these atrocities. I began a campaign against cattle rustling in my area. First, I persuaded my friends to join me in the campaign .25 was a good number to start with. We organized ourselves into groups of five. We visited various homesteads........ To me, what missed among my people was a lack of understanding between our two different cultures. The acceptance of our differences would come only with knowledge. This was my goal; to educate my people and make them find ways of uniting. Walking 10 miles each day, I would move from house to house campaigning against cattle rustling. Sometimes I missed school to do this task. I gave it my life. Days became weeks and months became years. The approach to my local area chief was a watershed for me. At first, he didn't take me seriously, but after interacting with him, he saw potential in me. His ceaseless support was an upper hand for me. I could now organize communal activities such as dam construction; trench building and sports activities to bring my community together. The chief also organized the ""wazee baraza"", formal meetings for the old, to emphasize unity and erase the animosity that existed within my community. , I could now move from school to school to talk to my peers and mentor them. I knew they were tomorrow's leaders and without appropriate nurturing, their future will not be different from their present. I wanted and sought change. The chief even approached religious leaders who helped organize gatherings. In the end, I was thrilled with the outcomes. A river of positive life encounters flooded inside my community. The cohesion I saw was miraculous; something I never had witnessed before. My people could now work towards realizing the highest aspirations as individuals and collectively as a community. Cattle rustling cases significantly went down. I have come to fully understand the importance of learning from failures. It should not hold us hostage. We have the capacity to rise again. Though, I may have wilted in the dark but I found some light at the end of the tunnel. This light materializes the luminous pride of family and the radiating heart of my grandfather. My brother's death and failure to protect him brought change to my society. Rest in peace; Daniel, grandfather."
"I know education is the most powerful weapon one can use to change the world; however, few schools provide this quality education that I yearn for. My ideal college will be a place where I will not be just an active student in class but a proactive student both in class and outside. A place where challenges are my daily tasks because I want to continue to outdo my intellectual capacity whenever an opportunity rises. On the same note a school that supports and nurtures talents will be ideal for me, this will enable me to remain a well all rounded student. While I will be receiving quality education, I will be growing into the transformative leader I would like to be. What inspires me most is the fact that I will be able to take back the global diversity I will experience during college time to my homeland country."
"My motivation comes from the people who saw potential in me when all I ever saw in myself was a measly seed, this endless encouragement and ceaseless support have helped me blossom into the vibrant, resilient flower I perceive myself today. I grew up in a community where education was less valued. As man in the family I was supposed to protect the family and take care of the cattle. However, despite the obstacles that I faced as I grew up my single mother to whom I give credit for my values, my morals and the sense of the world sacrificed all she ever had to make sure I got educated. I feel lucky that I shown the light and this leaves me a big task, how can I make sure the next generation get educated. I work hard not for myself but to make my community a better place."
"Responsible son ""You should be the man of the house when I'm gone. Take care of your mother and brother"", my dad said. ""But dad, I'm only ten"" I replied. ""Well, you are soon going to be a man, and you should learn to start doing so during my absence"" he replied. ""But Dad, I have to focus on school and keep my grades high. I don't think I can handle all of these while you're away"". You've got to deal with it son. I was able to do so, and I'm sure you'll also excel in your own way"", he added. Growing up in an African home, I had always been taught that being the firstborn son held greater responsibility. Whenever there wasn't enough food for the family, or whenever a sacrifice had to be made, my dad always made it a point that I be the one to make that sacrifice by taking a smaller ration so that my mom and younger brother could have the maximum benefit. I always never understood this until the day my father passed on. I was hit with the sad realization of what he had been preparing me for. My dad had left his own family behind in Nigeria to come to Ghana to change his fortunes. He had been the firstborn of his family, and realizing that the onus laid on him to change his family's fortunes, he took the step to set out into the world to find success. He had grown up in severe poverty, and had been affected by a learning disability that had disqualified him from having a normal education. With all his shortcomings, he always believed he could make things better for his family and himself. Hearing the stories of my father's past from my mom always endeared him to me and gave me a greater sense of fulfilling his wishes and being the man he had envisioned me to be. I thus took a vow to never let anything get in the way of my responsibilities which included taking care of my family as well as excelling in my academics. Taking responsibility at home wasn't as easy as I had expected. I thus had to sacrifice some of the other activities that normally took my time. Spending fewer hours with my friends on the basketball court was one of the difficult sacrifices I had to make. Instead of staying out on Saturday mornings, I would rather spend more time with my mom, who was an invalid, and my younger brother. Making sure that my mother took her medications to making sure that my brother stayed in line and out of trouble became part of my daily routines. It was really difficult juggling all those responsibilities, but whenever I felt like I could not keep up with the pressure, I always remembered my father sacrificing his own youth to give me the opportunities that I have. In school, whenever I had problems with calculus or other troubling topics in economics and felt like giving up, I would remember that my father was incapable of learning but had made it possible for me to have an education. With this in mind, I would stay behind in class and study till I was able to finally grasp whatever I had trouble with. All these changes in my values have been possible because of my father. My father's shining example I believe has made me aware of the struggles of people who find themselves in my situation. I am however rather proud that I have been able to learn how to sacrifice my time for the good of others. Also my environment has taught me to be dedicated, hardworking and high achieving, and I therefore know in the future I will be able set my own examples for others to emulate."
"Ever since my childhood, I have learned to challenge myself in every activity I engross myself in, because I believe that challenges help individuals to know the limits of their strengths so that they can better understand themselves. My pursuit of a new challenge has thus been my goal for looking forward to college. After successfully completing high school I have earned for a new challenge. A challenge that will quench my thirst for knowledge, as well as place me in a place of higher learning where I can liaise with other critical thinkers in order to help question notions and suggest answers to solve them."
"My most treasured books are the warrior series- a trilogy by Conn Iggulden. These books dramatize the struggles of the Mongol people during their pursuit of vengeance and freedom from the clutches of the chin empire. Genghis Khan, their leader, though a complete warrior in every aspect of the word, is someone whose struggles resonate with mine. Genghis suffered many hardships before his ascension to greatness. He lost his identity and right to rule his people. Even with all these adversities, he was able to salvage more than he had lost. He was able to make the Mongols a scourge to all those who had belittled them in the past. I have always believed that if anyone needs to cause a positive change in his/her fortunes, he/she needs to do so with hard work and determination, and because of the hard work Genghis showed, he was able to withstand adversity."
"Eureka! There it was among the sky gleaming. I kept tracking it for hours, days, and even months. I even decided to keep stalking it for the rest of my life. Like any seven-year-old kid, I used to believe in phantoms. I had the belief that there is something behind the scenes. My phantoms were a little bit divergent; they were all conspicuous around us. I don't know when the rigorous inception is, but what I remember is that it started with a crystal clear, harmonious, peaceful night sky right among the stars. I appreciated that elegance from the first glimpse, not only the spectacular scene but the tale behind the scene. The sky for me was a unique open bedtime tales book that allowed me to voyage through tons of stories in a single verse. The Hunter Orion is chasing the seven beautiful sisters- The Pleiades- while escaping the deadly Scorpion; the coronation of the Soul of Osiris with the Atef-crown is taking place; King of the South Narmer is conquering the North. ""It would take us nearly a millennium to perceive if Rigel, the brightest star in Hunter's constellation, ended its lifetime right now."" This sentence stopped me for a while. The fact that I might be staring at phantoms right now is preposterous. Since then I have begun to realize and appreciate the story behind the scene. I was enthusiastic to know about the unseen world, but instead of working with Ghostbusters or having Scooby-Doo, I am going to be working only with science. It captivated me the same way Aphrodite captivated Paris with her breathtaking beauty. It was the innocent charm of nature. Phusik? or the knowledge of nature as it was called by the Ancient Greeks or the science of the phantoms as I like to call it. I had a faithful, steadfast dedication like that of Horus to avenge his father, Osiris. I felt honor when they called me ""the physics guy"" while passing through the school corridors. I felt it while crossing continents, and attending summer programs in world-leading universities and international laboratories for the sake of the science of the phantoms. Taking part in the major physics competitions, being one of the top national finalists, and getting nominated for international competitions or programs weren't enough. I wanted to reach the roots and fulfill my passion. I wanted that feeling of triumph forever; a similar feeling to that of the Greeks on the doorsteps of Troy. It dawned as a small idea to form the physics club in the school with some of my friends. Kicking off with the primary protagonists, we looked for our side's Achilles. Being the research committee head motivated me to always keep an eye on the latest research papers and global journals' news. The outset was by doing various activities, hosting events, and preparing spectacular intriguing exhibitions. However, there is no such thing as a free lunch, a group of young men carrying their backpacks along with some weird homemade optical instruments seemed suspicious to many. I still remember that time when they thought we were burglars. We felt the strength of our determination while fluctuating like a sine wave. Experiencing baritone G3s didn't frustrate us from attaining much more soprano E5s. The clustering of my friends around me while I am stargazing is my best moment. I often make use of it to liberate my inner colloquial Aristotle, Homer, and Vivaldi. Swinging through topics like a pendulum, inaugurating by Plato's Utopia, going through Greek, Hieroglyphic, and Coptic languages history, and climaxing with some violin sonatas. All of these interests granted me unique skills and perspectives. They helped me in framing my personality. I am not certain of anything concerning the future not even tomorrow, but what I am sure of is that I will only regret the experiences I have missed."
"According to modern physics, it is defined as the fourth dimension. According to Merriam-Webster, it is defined as the measurable period during which an action continues: Time! It is the irreversible indication of our existence. Einstein said that the time could be dilated when we reach extremely high speeds, but unfortunately, that one does not work for the current pace of technological advancements. We were born in a significant period of time where most scientific fields were developing exponentially. This progress obliged us to speed up our daily life to keep up with the pressure caused by the incredible pace of our calculated lives. Nowadays we spend less time with family, friends, and even with our favorite books than people used to half a century ago. Thus, the most crucial challenge facing our generation in 50 years is the increasing stress because of the crowdedness of our schedules."
"I still remember that day when I returned home from kindergarten feeling proud of myself. ""Today I learned how to do Math."" I was ashamed of how I used to think the previous year. Soon after kindergarten, the elementary school introduced me to more concepts by which I achieved a better understanding of my world. This cycle continued for a while. In middle school, I saw through the cycle and stopped being surprised. Instead, I prepared myself for meeting my new wiser and more knowledgeable self the next year. My desire to meet the new improved me is my motivation to learn. I believe that this chain is infinite. No one will ever achieve perfection, as everyone is continuously met with new concepts and ideas, so I am not waiting for the best; instead I am waiting for the better."
"Leaning against my chest is the glossy, polished surface of my cello. As I place my bow on the string and glide it back and forth, it does not seem like an ordinary instrument anymore. Gradually, it evolves into something greater. A once living spruce and maple tree produce the sound of music, a transformation that requires reflection to visualize the larger picture, to create moments from notes, to create meaning, to create life, to create me. String one, the ""C"" string, contains the deepest sound that forms the base and foundation of my culture, beliefs, and childhood. Growing up in a Christian family, I have devoted myself to be a follower of God. My belief differed from that of my relatives in that the Chinese culture was mainly focused on maintaining the traditions of my predecessors. I have always felt like an outlier amongst my family; however, both our principles cohere on success, something we have both sought after. My parents, who have served as my role models, invigorated me to be a multifaceted person. Rather than watching television at home alone, I attended programs my parents believed would be beneficial to me, such as swimming lessons, Chinese lessons, music lessons, and chess tactics study groups at my local public library. Although these non-scholastic activities may have felt tedious, they impart knowledge to help me attain the motivation to succeed in everything I do. The ascending chromatic on the ""C"" string resembles my maturity and my rise to become independent. String two, the ""G"" string, consist of a warm and rich sound. It represents the time when music gradually influenced my life. Because of my rudimentary years of playing the piano, learning the cello was straightforward. Becoming a cello prodigy was my dream as I played the cello at every chance I had. I gathered many of my peers in my youth group and adults in the Chinese and English speaking congregations to participate in an ensemble for my church's Christmas Eve services. Hearing the crowd worship as one body allowed the music to fill up my mind and soul while generating an uplifting radiant warmth. I wanted to express the same free and intangible feeling I felt. In school, I also poured my emotions by using the art of my body movement to help guide my cello section and other sections to produce Mahler's First Symphony and Durufle's Requiem. Music became my form of communication and enabled me to open up my inner passions to my friends and family. String three is the ""D"" string, which has the potential to break through its surroundings to create a clear and euphonious sound. I have always yearned for reaching out to people not only empathetically, but also physically. Learning about medical missionaries at church allowed me to see altruistic teams being sent out to neglected third world countries. I had a desire to help out locally and discovered an interest in medicine. At home, my grandparents have always prepared dinner, a quotidian routine despite their elderly age. It was my responsibility to look after their health with attentive care. While attending to their medications, diet, and constant hospital visits, I have noticed an established doctor-patient relationship and the impact of science in people's lives. This new articulation on the ""D"" string represents me scaling upon the fingerboard to become a doctor. The final string is the ""A"" string, the bright one that holds my future. While I sit with my cello trying to reach the highest position, I have meditated upon my goals, dreams, and successes knowing that I am capable of achieving the highest notes. I have long endured the endeavor to be able to keep my faith and at the same time, to embrace the arts and science, and to look forward at what lies ahead for me."
"The Great Gatsby is a novel that intellectually stimulated my knowledge of American literature and society. I was engaged by the way Fitzgerald unveiled descriptive and vivid views each societal class held of the American Dream. The self-centered people in East Egg inherited ""old money"" while the people in West Egg worked for ""new money"". The social stratification in the novel created contrasting lifestyles between the characters. From this, I've noticed the daunting transition my grandparents' made to seek the American Dream for their future generations. My grandparents represent the ones in West Egg who sacrificed. I realize that I am fortunate to travel to school efficiently without having to walk miles on unpaved roads and to be able to have access to many opportunities. Although the dream was not accomplished in the novel, I believe that I'm living out my ancestors' aspirations, to make a difference in society."
"My ideal college is all-inclusive, with lush quads, unique course offerings, and many experiential opportunities. After touring Emory, I was immediately overwhelmed by the passion the staff had to introduce me around the campus. From the Anthropology Building to the Laboratory for Darwinian Neuroscience, I can take a Medical Anthropology course with Professor Brown and conduct world-renowned research with Dr. Leonard Howell. Given Wonderful Wednesdays at Asbury Circle, I can engage with the community through joining clubs like ChEmory and TEAC. Nonetheless, I can do internships and volunteer at the CDC and Emory University Hospital. As a cellist, I have a strong desire for the arts; I'm attracted to join the Emory University Symphony Orchestra and perform at the Schwartz Center with conductor Richard Prior. Overall, Emory University offers the ideal academic strategy, course of study, and cultural multiformity that will allow me to achieve my life and career ambitions."
"I lifted my arms as the guard's metal-detecting wand passed over me. Over my shoulder, I watched two stern armed officers search every inch of my car's interior. After being granted clearance, security pressed a button and a barricade of tire spikes retracted into the asphalt. As my car rolled over this mound, dozens of hand-crafted snow globes clanked together in the back seat. The cement walls of the National Institute of Health opened before me. Once on campus, I immediately got lost among the winding roads surrounding brick research buildings. Google Maps seemed equally confused by this maze. Asking for directions, I eventually made my way to the Children's Ward, a hidden Tudor building tucked amongst the greenery. Inside, I was taken aback by the hominess of the foyer's fireplace, Christmas streamers, and burgundy furniture. I signed in as the head of my service committee and carefully placed a bag of holiday cards and mason jars filled with cartoon figurines on the low countertop. Snow flurried within the confines of each glass, and the months of school-wide collaborations leading to this moment flashed before my eyes. Endless hours of communicating between school administrators, non-profit leaders, and the student body had become the most joyful part of my daily routine. Each step of the approval process--from scheduling the date of our first Good Deeds Day to orchestrating supplies, supervision and transportation--required careful coordination and a shared vision. I left the ward through the sliding glass doors, realizing they remained shut for the children inside. We had launched Good Deeds Day in hopes of reducing their sense of physical confinement. I was humbled by their battle with illness and felt particularly connected to their sense of isolation. A year and a half earlier I too faced my own situation of confinement: navigating a relationship with a mother struggling with mental illness. For the majority of my childhood I took on the role of my mother's caretaker. Every day--every hour spent at the barn with my horse--was also spent under her scrutiny. She followed me everywhere, and I was expected to do the same. Although I was rarely alone, her oppressing control made me feel especially lonely. Every minute I rode, she watched and criticized. If I asserted independence she would leave me on the side of the road. This dynamic progressed into an increasingly abusive relationship, culminating in two hours of testimony on a witness stand and a transfer of custody to my father. Although my time on the stand was grueling, finding composure amidst this emotional turmoil enabled me to break free of my mother's control. I hope my honesty helped her receive the support that she needs for her illness. Since then I have transferred to The Madeira School and my world has expanded to include cross country, cooking, school wide organizing, outdoor hikes, deeper friendships and a reconnection to my Judaism. Most importantly, the experience developed my sense of agency and ability to advocate for myself and others. My first week at Madeira began a new chapter in my life. I had found a place that shares my passion for community outreach and had been elected head of the junior class committee as an unknown transfer student. When I spoke before my new classmates and asked for their support I did not feel shy or nervous. Discovering my voice in court had given me freedom. Drawing on this experience, I understood that our voices are never useless, especially when standing up to forces that feel overpowering. Looking out from the podium I felt connected to an open world of fresh opportunities. As I imagined my vision for Good Deeds Day, and finding a place in this new community, I experienced a profound calm within myself. I closed my eyes, opened them, took a deep breath, and said my first word: hello."
"Kanye West is a polarizing figure, but his talent is undeniable. The Life of Pablo, with its melodic beats, angered tone, and spinning lyrics sets the perfect pace for cross country training, providing a momentary escape from reality. Raging words of liberation draw my mind into a spiraling vortex. When I can't take anymore uphill inclines, my stride become synchronized to the bass of ""FML."" Slowing drum beats have a calming effect. The tempo increases. My legs become lighter with the angelic soprano, ""Can't let them get to me."" Suddenly, West drops into falsetto. I feel unstoppable. ""Waves"" erupts and I'm running faster, immersed in a summer memory of Venice Beach, chasing tides and laughter. I'm smiling. ""I just want to feel liberated"" transports me to an invigorating hike through the Cinque Terre. ""You're the only power"" reminds me to push through physical pain. Only one more step to go."
"When I visited Emory last April, I immediately sensed a deeply connected community. Walking into the DUC lobby, I was struck by the upbeat atmosphere of the students gathered inside. Across multiple floors students brainstormed--hovering over oval coffee tables, discussing SIRE student-faculty research, and reading the Emory Wheel. Inside, the palpable energy of free-flowing ideas mirrored the cosmopolitanism that I had pictured in a thriving college. I easily struck up a conversation with a rising Sophomore eager to discuss her philanthropic study abroad in Israel. When I toured the Goizueta building, I watched suited students from all over the world participate in a sport of the mind: collaborating in a circle before giving a presentation. The inclusivity of these students inspired me. This interactive, conference-style of teaching resonates with the way I like to learn. I'm applying early decision because I can confidently say that Emory is my ideal campus."
"It took me a considerably long time to figure out that I am a coconut. Before that I kept rolling from place to place, person to person, wondering why I could never be the 'commercial girl', laughing with my huge circle of friends. To make up for my low social life, I used the internet. I looked up my ideas and learnt to implement them. Every day was like an episode of Phineas and Ferb. I'd make a website, direct an animated video, play a virtual keyboard, or learn a language. On one such adventure, I signed-up for a dress-up game site, carton doll emporium. My username on the site was brainy. Needless to say, this sparked a lot of attention. I've had people asking, ""What were you thinking when you picked that name?"" My answer had always been ""I'm glad my username isn't taken?"" On this site, I often tuned into Fierycupcake's (a staff's username) contest. I vowed to win at least one of them. Finally, I ended up winning a cupcake drawing contest. This was my stumble across a victory ladder for soon after that, I also won a contest for a contest idea - my idea was to write a letter to Santa on behalf of someone else (example: the President writing a letter to Santa). I was even nominated for the CDE superstars for 'the Smartest Person on CDE' and 'the Biggest Fierycupcake Fan' (I campaigned for the latter position). People started commissioning me to draw their avatars, despite my primitive art skills. These contests go further than just winning. One of Fierycupcake's contests was to write a poem. I had till then considered poetry a boring affair, something inconceivably high for me. The essence of words simply didn't hit me. But my vow made me sit up and spill my thoughts into a page. I sent it in with a grin, telling myself I'd win. I owe my love for writing to that day. On the internet, when people were just behind monitors, I couldn't see what they were doing. Since I couldn't see what they were doing, I automatically assumed my true nature instead of mirroring others. And hence, I fit in. Why can't I do that in real life? Years later, I opened the poem I had sent to read a syntactically incorrect, meaningless blob of words. When I showed it to my teacher then, she hadn't had the heart to tell me what I had actually written. She resorted to smiling at me and moving on with her work. But I mistook her smile for assurance that I was good at English, the opposite of which was true. I started writing stories that I had conjured up in my mind when my parents hadn't had the time to tell me stories. These stories made the readers of the class surround me and chase me for sequels. They somehow understood my language. Reading more books fueled me more. I found myself emptying more and more notebooks. The girls who didn't read surrounded me in lunch and listened to me narrate the story with a half-filled mouth. And lo behold, I gained friends. But why am I a coconut? The friends I gained through my stories were shocked to see me. They asked when I joked, ""I can't believe you talk like that!"" The few friends I did have had been with me through a roller coaster. They helped me choose the name of the magazine I started when I was in fourth grade. They picked the colors for my site header. They critiqued the songs I recorded. But when they saw me for the first time in a corner with my face laced by the sunbeam shooting through the open window, brooding about coding motion capture using OpenCV, they only saw my hard fibrous outside. They didn't think of the sweet water inside."
"I've never walked past a wall Marina Diamandis had walked past. Yet, as though by fate, I stumbled across her songs accidentally on YouTube. I didn't love her in the beginning - her songs were too unconventional to me then. Songs she wrote like Lonely Hearts Club and Buy the Stars hit me with a supernatural level of meaning. I soon found myself crying as I listened to Numb. I started my Facebook page after singing with Are You Satisfied? and read The Feminine Mystique while listening to Can't Pin Me Down (about how she will never confirm to unnecessary societal preconceptions of her character) Her songs such as Troubled Mind and Obsessions have also a special place in my heart for talking about the stigma around mental disorders. I won't be understating if I said that all her songs are my favorites."
"Nothing but learning motivates me to learn. I don't see learning as a process where I get my reward at the end. To me, learning is the reward. This is the reason I shifted from my State Board to Central Board of education despite being hugely criticized. This is the reason I am applying to Emory university now. This world is like a jig-saw puzzle to me - revealing its true self with every little secret I uncover. This secret might be a simple physical law or a human flaw. Knowing this piece of information, I can go on and develop existing systems. I can be a muggle with magical powers. I started with myself - learning about MBTI and other such psychological systems to understand myself better- and now am moving towards contributing to my community through my fiction and non-fiction writing."
"In 2009, I was a chubby, half-Asian boy with an eager persona and an elevated sense of optimism. That same year, Pixar developed the character of Russel for the movie Up. Upon watching the film, I realized the myriad similarities between Russel and me. We shared everything from looks and personality to scouting and ethnic-background. But most of all, Russel and I shared a yearning for adventure. I have had an unquenchable appetite for adventure since childhood. My friends and I always played outside, exploring my neighborhood and imagining fantastical quests to complete. When Christmas and birthdays came around, road trips and camping equipment were the only gifts on my lists, for I had a single goal: go out and explore. Inevitably, I realized the Boy Scouts was the perfect activity for me. Each month, my friends and I escaped the city to live in the woods, using the skills we learned in weekly meetings to live. Not only did I venture into a setting that was new to me, but I developed the confidence, independence, and knowledge necessary to live on my own. From canoeing down the Shenandoah River to leading a two-week hike through the desert of New Mexico, I became comfortable in unknown and extreme environments and sure of my own ability to survive. As I grew older and led the troop, I began teaching the younger scouts the survival skills I had mastered over the years. Empowering these scouts with the skills needed to survive, I watched them develop as purposeful, determined, and independent individuals just as I had done. On my eighteenth birthday, I was no longer a Boy Scout. Instead, I proudly earned the title of Eagle Scout; a designation that remains with me for life. After twelve years of scouting, my sense of adventure had matured just as I had. I sought a new adventure with two goals: quenching my thirst for new experiences and putting the skills I had mastered to work by helping others. I took a job as a cashier and, after saving my money, I funded and am now in the midst of my latest enterprise: a global gap year dedicated to providing charity to those in need. I am traveling alone throughout Southeast Asia, working every day with organizations that make a change in their communities. In the Philippines and Bangkok, I taught class to orphaned and underprivileged youths. In Siem Reap, Cambodia, I built water filtration systems for impoverished villages. And in Phnom Penh, I provide legal and professional aid to Cambodian minorities and refugees who face endemic and deep-seated cultural discrimination. I gain a sense of fulfillment from making a difference wherever I work, but the ways in which each community challenges my thinking and makes me reevaluate what I take for granted is just as valuable. In different environments, I assimilate with diverse cultures and adapt to completely new social structures; I listen to new perspectives and use them to question and amend my own outlook on issues. As I work each day, I remember Russel, who began his adventure with the goal of earning his ""Assisting the Elderly"" merit badge. While our adventures could not differ more, we share the same goal: help others. And just as Russel had learned from helping his elderly neighbor, I find that helping others benefits me by enriching my understanding of others and the breadth of socio-economic structures which rely on the kindness of humanity. I am no longer the naive preteen that Russel represented, and I look forward to coming out of my gap year more mature and knowledgeable than I was a year earlier. However, I will remain an adventurer even after I return, and I am ready for my next adventure this fall: as a student at Emory University."
"My favorite fiction is not remarkable for composition, but rather for how it inspired me. In primary school, my father would read me Encyclopedia Brown mysteries; he paused near the end of each story and challenged me to solve each case. I listened attentively and developed an understanding for the dramatic principle of Chekhov's Gun. Each mystery Encyclopedia solved brought justice to a victim - a justice that I later realized was the foundation of real-world legal principles. I became engrossed in the legal system - interning with a federal judge and working at a minority rights NGO to deepen my understanding of the law and make an impact in local communities. Encyclopedia may have been fictional, but he showed me that even a teen can bring justice to the world. As I pursue my passion for law, it is Encyclopedia who reminds me where my desire for justice began."
"My ideal college environment requires cooperative critical thinking and a student body and faculty with broad experiences to contribute to that thinking- where student's opinions, thoughts, and pre-conceived ideas are challenged inside and outside of the classroom. After completing high school, I lived abroad for a year and thrived on the experience of hearing varied and completely opposite viewpoints from around the world. Whether it is a Cambodian farmer sharing his perceptions on raising a family or an Argentine schoolteacher longing for an authoritarian government, the richness of education is being able to acknowledge other viewpoints. Nearly one-in-five of Emory's class of 2020 is an international student and the remaining 82 percent are well distributed from around the nation. The various viewpoints that will be shared on campus will strengthen my education, forming a curriculum based on inquiry not only from books but also from the experiences of others."
"Dogs... to most children they are a loving companion. Their furry friends are cuddle buddies they see for a few minutes a day. Unlike my peers, my dogs are a lifestyle. When I was four, my father passed away. Knowing his days were numbered, I spent most of my time with him. After he died, my heart was crushed and I did not know what to do with myself. My Mum decided that it was a good time to take me to my first dog show. Immediately, I fell in love and the void in my heart began to mend. Looking back, I would not be who I am today without my dogs. At any given time, my mother and I live with five to ten dogs. I have been involved in American Kennel Club dog shows, agility, therapy work, lure coursing, rescue, breeding and I have been member of several kennel clubs (Central Ohio Kennel Club, Buckeye Samoyed Club and Samoyed Club of America). By age ten, I began shadowing one of Ohio's best veterinarians, Mark E. Harris, DVM. At thirteen, I began working for top professional handlers which entails twelve-hour days caring for up to 30 of the country's top show dogs. While traveling the country, we communicate with clients and schedule handlers. By sixteen, I was working at the veterinarian's office and quickly became my manager's assistant, training new hires. Recently, I have been working with the veterinary technicians, the next step to becoming a veterinarian assistant. In my spare time, I led a project to raise money and build dog beds for our local animal shelter and was the Trophy Chairperson for the Buckeye Samoyed Club. In this role, I was responsible for creating 100 trophies for participants. I have been the top Samoyed Junior Handler for three years and won Best Junior Handler at our annual National Samoyed Specialty three times. This record led me to be invited to judge sweepstakes at two Samoyed regional specialties. I am the youngest Samoyed judge in AKC history. At several local shows I have won scholarship money for a combination of my good grades and dog show wins. The last eight years I qualified for the AKC Eukanuba National Championship and Westminster Kennel Club. My mother and I obtained seven championships on our personal dogs, two grand championships and helped get points on countless others. Together we titled our dogs in agility and lure coursing. I earned a therapy dog certification. This allows me to give back to the community by visiting health-care facilities and nursing homes with my therapy dog. My canine family has sculpted who I am. My dogs are my life. They were literally born in my room, raised sleeping in my bed, and were groomed, conditioned and trained for countless hours. There is no greater gratification than when those beloved family members win big. One day I hope to raise and handle my very own Best In Show dog. I also aspire to judge a Samoyed National Specialty. All of this seems like it only helps in the dog world, but it has also gotten me far personally. Dog Shows are unlike any other sport because the dogs never go away. I cannot just put a ball away and take off my cleats for the night. Having champion show dogs takes knowledge, determination, responsibility and endurance. Understanding the genetics, breed history, and bloodlines is essential to produce quality puppies. Working for the veterinary office and professional handlers has instilled hard work, time management, communication skills, teamwork and leadership in me. My furry friends get me going in the morning and are what I curl up with at night. They are my family. Most importantly, they helped me go through hardship and come out with a sense of pride and the ability to handle any situation."
"My favorite film, Secretariat: The Impossible True Story, gives me goose bumps because of the strength of the protagonist, Penny Chenery Tweedy. She is a typical 1970s housewife, until she inherits her father's horse farm. Against the wishes of her family, Penny continues to run the farm. People in the horse industry held her in little regards when she began to race a red colt, Secretariat. For years, Penny chose to juggle a family and become a business owner in an industry dominated by men. By the end of the movie, against all odds, she achieved greatness. Secretariat won the triple crown and set a record that has yet to be broken. I hope that in the face of discouraging circumstances I can stand against the odds, like Penny, and succeed. This is my favorite movie because it empowers me to be the best and persevere through trialling times."
"Many people and life events have motivated me to learn. I am thankful for my teachers, who have shared their knowledge, my mom, for her encouragement, and my friends, who faced the classes with me. The one person who has had the most influence watches over me from above. My father died when I was very young. He instilled in me to be a life long learner because he came from a less fortunate family with little schooling. When my father fell ill, he made it his mission to prepare my tiny brain the best he could. We went over the ABC's, counting, and reading. When able, we went to the Zoo, visited museums and traveled. He showed me how to experience life. I am motivated because I want to make him proud and exceed his hopes of what I am able to accomplish."
"I am afraid. I am afraid that I'm going to make the same mistakes that I made last time. I am afraid that I won't be able to communicate who I am and why I deserve to go to your university in 650 words. I am afraid that six months from now, I won't have any clearer idea of my future than I do now. I didn't choose any of these fears, but I do get to choose how I deal with them. The same goes for any fear I've encountered within my lifetime. When I entered the throes of adolescence, I was afraid of being ordinary. I felt ordinary and feared that all my future held was mediocrity. I was an average athlete, an average student, and a fairly predictable teenage boy. I felt like I fit the perfect cookie cutter version of a middle-class white teenager from any small town in the United States. No matter how irrational the fear, it felt like anything I did had already been expected of me. So, I did something unexpected, I decided to study abroad my junior year of high school. Not only did I apply to an exchange program behind my parents' backs, but I also applied to a country in which the natives spoke a language that I was completely unfamiliar with. My friends called me crazy, I called myself adventurous. At first, this act of defiance was an attempt to escape the ordinary, but over the course of a year, it became so much more. That year abroad awakened a wanderlust within me and gave me direction for my future career choice. I learned that I loved exploring others' cultures and hearing their stories. After that year abroad, I realized that I didn't have to be afraid anymore. Proving to myself that it was possible to conquer one fear triggered a chain reaction of victories over fears that had held me captive for years. I started to live the life I wanted to live and not the one that fear dictated. I used to be afraid of being a leader. Then, I became one of the leaders of the largest student organization in my high school. I used to be afraid of performing in front of large crowds. Now, there is a YouTube video of a group of friends and me doing a six-minute dance routine in front of our entire student body that now has over 16,000 views on YouTube. Looking at my college options in May of 2016, I probably should've been afraid. I was faced with options that, as a first-generation student who is paying for college on his own, I knew I couldn't afford. Instead of being afraid of what my future held, I took it into my own hands. I decided that I didn't want to graduate college with debt that would weigh me down for years to come. So, I took a gap year. Two years ago, I would've never taken a gap year. I would've been too afraid of all of the unknowns. However, I am not the same person I was two years ago. I am more empowered to take control of my own narrative and decide where I want to head next. The most powerful thing we can do in our lives is to take control of our own narratives. Before my year abroad, I was just going through the motions, doing what others told me to do and allowing fear to have a role in my decision making. After my year abroad, I was empowered to take control of my story and decide just exactly how I wanted it to be written. That decision was the best one I've ever made, and has shaped and continues to shape how I live my life-a life free of fear's constraints. A life I plan to lead in college."
"For my senior prom, I wore a rubber ducky novelty tie. I found it funny that all my friends had spent inordinate amounts of money on their prom getup and I wore Chuck Taylor's. I guess I never really took things like prom seriously and I feel like that's one of the reasons why How I Met Your Mother is my favorite TV show. In it, no matter how serious the situation, the characters always found a way to laugh. I've also always been a fan of shows and characters that don't take themselves too seriously. It's a very important to be able to laugh when life seems dreary and I found that in How I Met Your Mother."
"My parents never went to college, my father barely graduated high school and my mother was a straight C student. For only having a high school diploma, they've done very well for themselves but every time I heard my Dad start his truck at 4AM on a Saturday morning or saw my mother balancing the company account at 11PM, I am reminded of the sacrifice that they made each and every day to put food on the table for me and my five siblings. Seeing this every day for the majority of my childhood motivated me to aspire towards something bigger. It motivated me to work harder in school than the other kids did and it's what ultimately motivates me to learn as much as I possibly can so that I can have access to opportunities that they never had."
"My mother and I were driving down a country road in Lexington, Kentucky, blasting the local college radio station when I saw it- that golden sign. It was a beacon of hope, summoning me. My stomach started to growl, and I knew it was fate. We turned down the long road and began the final stretch towards my palace, Waffle House. As we pulled into the parking lot, my anticipation grew. I knew that, inside the slightly run-down brick building, plates were filled with buttery goodness. My mind was spinning with all of the possibilities. How did I want my hash browns? Did I want chocolate chips in my waffles? Little did I know, I was about to embark not only on a culinary journey, but also a cultural one. My mom held the door for me and we entered. The servers and cooks welcomed us with smiles and a chorus of greetings in their warm Kentucky drawl. Even the other diners joined in. It was like my mother and I were famous, but as the next diners entered the building, they received the same treatment. That was the moment I realized how genuinely cordial these people are. I have eaten at plenty of fine dining establishments, but none can compare to the service and warm atmosphere of this Waffle House. The waitress took an order nearby, humming a song under her breath. My mother instantly recognized that she was humming ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered,"" by Stevie Wonder, which is also my mom's favorite song. Before I knew it, Mom was humming along with the waitress. The waitress walked over to the jukebox located in the back corner of the restaurant and inserted a few quarters. All of a sudden, Stevie Wonder's brilliant lyrics were blasting through the restaurant. My mom started to belt out the song, and I was completely mortified. Other diners started to join her, and finally, I got off my high horse and sang as well. Everyone in the restaurant was from a different background. There were African-American families, Latino families, and even one waitress with a Kentucky accent who was speaking to the customers in fluent Spanish. Still, we were all united in our love for good music, good food, and an even better atmosphere. It is amazing how a small, humble restaurant can bring such a diverse group of people together. In today's technologically immersed world, everyone could use a little Waffle House in their lives. It is considered weird, and possibly rude, to just talk, let alone sing, with strangers. You are expected to interact only with people from your group of society, and ignore those who are different from you. This is a major problem with mainstream American culture. Why not embrace different cultures and types of people? We shouldn't fear diversity, but instead consider ourselves lucky to have such a diverse group of people in one place. Every person has something that makes them unique, and by isolating yourself, you never get to learn what others may have to offer. In this day and age, it is extremely important to put down your phone, free yourself from distractions, and embrace your surroundings. Talk to someone new; help someone in need; and visit your local Waffle House."
"While technology can be extremely advantageous, it can also be a major detriment to society. Last summer, when I was in Cuba, my group didn't have access to our phones or any other form of connection to the outside world. Initially, it was extremely awkward because none of us knew how to socialize without the influence of technology. As the trip progressed, however, we discovered other ways of having fun, such as playing cards and having meaningful discussions. This made me aware of how overly reliant we are on technology. We should not have had such a difficult time facilitating social interactions, and I realized that we were missing out on the simple joys of life, like having conversations. While technology certainly has its benefits, we must balance them with the values of face-to-face interaction."
"While it may not be the most intellectual choice, my favorite book is Gone Girl, by Gillian Flynn. This book came into my life at exactly the right time. As a young girl, I had a passion for reading and would spend hours with only a book. However, as I got older, my joy for reading diminished. Sure, I would read the books assigned, but I would do so begrudgingly and without truly enjoying them. Gone Girl was a part of my winter break assignment in 2014. I reluctantly started reading, assuming that I wouldn't enjoy it. Instantly, however, I was captivated by Flynn's story, and finished the entire book within two days. I was upset with how Flynn ended her novel, and questioned her literary decisions, yet once again I found myself actively engaged in a book. This was the moment that I regained my joy for reading."
"11. 13. 17. No, the next number isn't 19, nor is this a random sequence of prime numbers; these numbers represent my life: eleven countries, along with thirteen different addresses, by the age of seventeen. In 1998, I, Yubin, first perceived the world through the busy streets of Seoul. Concealed in a bushy parka, two-year-old Yubin toddled around the avenues of Gothenburg, Sweden. By the age of six, Yubin was pledging to the American Flag in his eighth country, the United States. My encounter with the United States began with the Aloha State. During my time in Hawaii, I had the opportunity to take a field trip to Pearl Harbor. As soon as we arrived, we bolted into a nearby theater. Our class overcrowded the compact theater just in time for a documentary on the date which will live in infamy. My eyes fixated on the vintage film and I was drawn into President Franklin Roosevelt's thick voice. Suddenly, the screen illuminated to a fluorescent white and the sound of airplanes swarmed the cinema. I was petrified, as explosions reverberated across the room. The scene was too appalling to contemplate and the uproar sent chills down my spine. The screening concluded with the dropping of the atomic bomb, signifying American victory. It was another stereotypical documentary that engendered patriotism and made the viewer realize how great of a country America is. I too, was moved by this powerful film and I naturally was inclined to despise the immoral Japanese. As I trudged out the theater, I was greeted by the snug weather of Hawaii. Out in the corner of my eye, I detected the beautiful USS Arizona Memorial tranquilly resting on the ocean. I was staring at a piece of history that sparked the United States to join World War Two. A huge smile ran across my cheeks, for I couldn't hide my contentment. It was not difficult to emphasize with Americans after watching that film. While I was mesmerized by the memorial, my teacher, Mrs. Araki, hollered, ""Okay students, gather up your belongings and let's go eat lunch!"" ""Wait."" I thought to myself. ""Mrs. Araki. She's Japanese."" Then it hit me; I was encompassed by Japanese. My friend Joshua was Japanese. A bulk of tourists around me were Japanese. Heck, the ticket booth at the entrance of Pearl Harbor was run by a Japanese man. This was the first time I was exposed to cultural interaction, consciously. The United States and Japan had one of the most monumental conflict in the modern world, yet if one looks into the demographics of Hawaii, he will find that the majority of the population is Japanese. They say Hawaii is a paradise and I fully agree with the saying. Sure, it has the natural sceneries, but Hawaii is also place where cultural barriers are overcome. Located in the heart of the Pacific, Hawaii acts a bridge between Asia and America. On another level, Hawaii is a paradise of culture. Through the years spent at Hawaii, I was able to grasp the concept of cultural interaction. Despite the history and differentiation, the Japanese and the Americans were able to put the distinction aside in order to coexist and intermingle. This opportunity to live in a place where diverse people harmonize was an eye opening experience. I strive to be like Hawaii: understanding diverse cultures and turning the comprehension into a skill of communication. Stepping foot in eleven countries by the age of seventeen has exposed me to people with different cultures and backgrounds. Because of this unique opportunity I had, I am able to sympathize and empathize on a higher level. I hold the qualities to become a successful leader in this world shrunken by globalization. Understanding other cultures will be key in the future. Through my diversity, I endeavor to be the heart of the world, the bridge between two cultures."
"Black lives matter. Love wins. I stand with Ahmed. Our generation is challenged to find unity within diversity. Despite being a problem that persisted for centuries, division is a puzzle yet to be solved. Our society is deeply rooted in the belief that we, humans, are created differently and must work to negotiate the differences. The case of Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 triggered fundamental rights granting same-sex couples the right of marriage, which angered many who believed in traditional marriage. President Elect Donald Trump infuriated minorities who felt belittled by his ""White Supremacy."" We can never come together and accept our differences because in a world that promotes survival of the fittest, we want standards that put ""my type of people"" at the top of the hierarchy. Instead, we need to find diversity within unity: understand that we are all created equally and therefore, can celebrate our gifted differences."
"As a member of Generation Z, I am a fan innovation. Perhaps, writing about ""The Symphony No. 5"" of Beethoven is more fitting in a college application, but I cannot help but to talk about one of my favorite albums, Kanye West's The College Dropout, and its innovativeness. Kanye West considers the greatest instrument ever to be the human voice. Most traditional tracks would consist of an instrumental beat backed by vocals. However, in The College Dropout, vocal performances are not limited to just singing or rapping; the album is jampacked with the human voice. For example, in the grammy winning song ""Jesus Walks,"" West sampled the ARC choir's song ""Walk With Me,"" which became the baseline, the percussion, and the melody. Every single nook and cranny is filled with the human voice. West's album pushed the music industry forward while giving us a chance to celebrate the human voice."
"denismugambi@none.none:Yes,this was my email address!It appeared in the next column beside my name on the list of the participants at the 2010 Global Leadership Adventures summer program in Nairobi, Kenya.All the other participants had their ""correct"" or rather ""right"" email addresses and my soul-searching and contemplation over what had me lagging behind technologically resulted in deep sorrow but more importantly in a life-changing awakening. As each of the other participants, most of whom hailed from fiscally healthy backgrounds, teased me, an idea of how I could change my predicament as well as that of others like me would flash through my mind.My attempts to persuade the other participants into helping me create my own email account, even after explaining to them how my home and school environment lacked ICT infrastructure and interest, proved futile.Indeed, the biggest thing that we would do with computers was to play GTA Vice City and Spider Solitaire.The contrary was true:""You must be kidding,"" they giggled.The idea about an individual, living in this day and age, without an email address, was neither here nor there I still vividly remember the day: it was on a cool Saturday afternoon when I stormed into the GLA's computer lab booming with optimism, zeal, and curiosity.Seated nervously in front of one of the monitors of the shared desktop computers, I gripped the mouse fretfully under my damp right-hand palm.I pretended to navigate through computer programs as a chilly stream of sweat flowed down my body in anxiety and uneasiness.A strange feeling, convincing me that something great was imminent, overwhelmed me. By chance, or rather accidentally, the cursor stumbled on an internet explorer icon, whose window launched almost immediately on a click.I then guessingly typed 'yahoo.com' on the welcome search page; google and clicked on the ""yahoomail.com"" hyperlink.When the next page was displayed, I clicked on ""sign up'' which subsequently opened a lengthy page requiring me to fill in my details.""Is this similar to a driving licence application?""I wondered.I struggled due to my then poor typing skills and having to make several repetitions as my password failed for not mixing upper and lower cases and compliance to the 8-character lower limit.To me, online privacy was meaningless.However, I held on and after an hour of a technological fight, the battle was won: I successfully created my current email address 'denismuga@ymail.com' with the password 'NIMeanza'-Swahili for, I have just started; which I changed later on security grounds. Looking back at how much I have come in this journey, from being the laughing stock of 'cool kids' due to my technological illiteracy to being the ICT representative at The Alliance High School, I cannot help but hope for a future where I can achieve my dream of building technology products for the world to spur economic growth.My failure shaped my life and without it, my life wouldn't be as incredible as it is today, and I can't help but wince every time I look back at the kind of kid that I was.As I help build a healthcare technology startup hand and sort out technology-related problems, most believe it has been a life-long story; however, the contrary holds, it is simply started as the denismugambi@none.none story."
"I live in a generation of a broken society. The cracks of inequality and discrimination cut so deep I could almost feel them when I open my window every morning. Corruption lingers, social inequality crumples the very bed I lie on. I walk in the streets I call home and pass beggars borrowing money, every next one looking as desperate as the previous. Momentarily, a drunk father comes to empty the can of coins his children have been begging for all day, leaving them hungry. Close by, a robber grabs a woman's purse. In the street, a politician gives an address. Lies, vanity. The people listen. They clap. I watch in glum. My broken society. For as long as I remember, I have always hoped that the situation would be different."
"When I was growing up, my grandpa developed an inveterate culture of randomly querying my cousins and me on various broad topics ranging from physics, to math, and to some great extent, contemporary pop culture. At the time, we didn't know most of the answers to his questions so we would stare at him with nescient expressions plastered across our faces. His questions fascinated me and I regard them to be the very seeds that birthed the inexplicable penchant that I have for general knowledge. His questions were the spark to my intellectual curiosity. I became fascinated by the world and wanted to learn everything about everything. I would delve into the vast array of information that was offered by The Encyclopedia Britannica. My love for general knowledge is my source of intellectual vitality"
"As I pressed in the plunger of the micropipette and the DNA sample was dispensed into the well of the agarose gel, I was fascinated by the jelly-like substance's ability to separate fragments of DNA to create a unique DNA fingerprint. I continued to place all of the DNA samples into their respective wells, and waited anxiously for the DNA fingerprints to develop. From the DNA fingerprints produced by the gel electrophoresis, I had to determine which of the suspects' DNA samples, if any, matched the DNA found on the ""crime scene."" Though there was no real crime for which we had to pinpoint a suspect, I was determined to solve the mystery that my favorite biology teacher had created. The experiment's use of DNA to identify a specific person elicited my passion for investigating genetics, and using genetics to solve a problem much bigger than the experiment I solved in high school: the lack of cures for a multitude of diseases and disorders. I became interested in finding cures for a neurological disorders when I was young, as my father developed Guillan-Barre Syndrome. I wondered why my healthy father was losing the ability to walk, and watched as he was hospitalized for his increasingly paralytic condition. As I grew older, I researched the rare disorder, and discovered that his weakness was caused by an attack on neurons by the immune system. Since the disorder that had afflicted my father was extremely uncommon, relatively little research had been conducted to find a cure. My father's temporary loss of the use of his legs was extremely troubling for my family, because as a farmer he relied on them to control the machinery that enabled him to plow the fields and harvest the bountiful corn and soybeans. Though my father recovered and regained the use of his legs, I was inspired to help others who suffer from neurological disorders. To tackle the problem of disorders such as Guillan-Barre Syndrome, I want to initiate research that employs precision medicine to find treatments catered to the individual. Precision medicine has already been used at the Winship Cancer Institute by Dr. Adam Marcus to identify why the same kind of cancer cells in two different patients act differently, and to develop treatments that target specific genes that have mutated. The progress of this knowledge regarding genetics and the properties of cancer cells enables researchers to conceive treatments that can halt metastasis in its tracks. Through the study of genomes of the cells affected by these disorders, genetic mutations that impact neural functions can be identified. After identifying the genetic mutations that are at the core of many neurological problems, I will work on creating treatments that repair those genetic mutations, thereby restoring neural function. By combining the study of the inner workings of the brain and the nervous system and research in genetics, I can work towards helping others overcome neurological disorders and other diseases by developing effective treatments."
"The passionate jazz music, dirty streets of New Orleans, and Stella and Stanley's tattered apartment come together to make A Streetcar Named Desire a classic film that portrays the the vulnerabilities of women following World War II in the American Southeast. I fell in love with the film and Marlon Brando's compelling performance the first time I watched A Streetcar Named Desire. I had the opportunity to play Blanche Dubois when I collaborated with my classmates in AP Literature to create a new scene for the movie. We stayed up late editing our script, filmed on iphones in bowling alleys and outside pubs, and added music from various time periods in order to modernize the classic film. Our creation of the new scene for A Streetcar Named Desire forever added a deeper meaning to the film for me, and elicited a great appreciation for the dismal storyline of Blanche Dubois."
"Over the past five years, I have memorized countless German verb patterns and developed speaking skills through spontaneous discussions in my German classes. I did not truly discover the amazing benefits of learning a foreign language until I realized I could communicate with the foreign exchange students my school hosted during my junior year. Because of my years studying the German language and culture, I was able to learn about their lives and perspectives and introduce them to my own. I have discovered that my passion for learning is motivated by the desire to connect with others, whether in the form of communicating with people who speak another language, using statistical tests to carry out an experiment that will yield cures in my quest to help those who are suffering from disease, or learning new choreography for a dance performance that will convey my artistic expression to an audience."
"""You're fat,"" my mom blurts out, staring at me as I read Harry Potter. ""You're not so skinny yourself,"" I snap back. The all too familiar words squeeze the air out of my lungs. I have enough of a sense of self that I don't keep quiet. Verbal retaliation is the only way I know to deflect this sudden and unkind remark. I could be doing anything - rolling out of bed in the morning, telling her about my day at school, playing soccer - when these accusations slap me in the face. At first, I am able to ignore these afflicting insinuations. However, as I undergo puberty, my confidence falters. Whenever I step on the scale, my heart drops, dreading the new digits that emerge. I panic. I start to see myself as the ugly, obese beast of my mother's remarks. Older kids at my school begin to make nasty comments about my appearance and sexually harass me. A school administrative staff takes notice of the phenomenon and decides to blame me for the harassment. ""You must have done something for them to pick on you,"" she says, telling me that I am too headstrong and vocal for a girl, hinting to the time when I stood up to an administrator for targeting my best friend for being effeminate. While I am baffled by the fallacies hidden within these remarks, the negative messages work into my subconscious. I stop believing in myself or my ability to accomplish even the smallest things.At the age of thirteen, i find myself tearfully confronting my parents on the full body spanxs that they bought me. I loathe my existence and just want to be invisible. I begin to dress and act based on solely what I calculate would make me unremarkable and unnoticeable. I feel worthless. Eighth grade is the turning point in my life. I attend an international school where I encounter drastically different ways of thinking. I learn about feminism, cultural violence, and many other ways to interpret my world that were previously unavailable to me. Debate club and Model UN help me find my worth. This individualistic approach to learning helps me regain my confidence. I rediscover myself as someone who is optimistic and politically engaged. Most importantly, the core of my identity is now defined by the fact that I speak up for those who don't have a voice. As my confidence and sense of self grow, I resent my parents for making me feel the way they do. However, eventually I realize that my mom said those things to me because she herself felt insecure. I notice how my father constantly comments on my mother's weight. I recall that shortly after his demeaning comments begin, she tries ridiculous diets and stays at the gym for 6 hours a day. She claims that she does this for her health, but her constant comparison of our bodies, hers and mine, to that of super models gives it all away. After realizing her insecurities, I tell her how beautiful and strong she is and how grateful I am for her stretch marks. I talked to my father about how his comments make my mom feel; eventually, his comments cease. Finally, my mom stops testing out those ridiculous diets, exercises at a more reasonable rate, and eventually, stops making deprecating comments about herself and me. My experiences have taught me to be confident and empathetic, to pay more attention to people, to understand their motivations and fears. I have stopped complaining about how things are wrong and unfair and have started to see it as my responsibility to take action and fix the problems. This process of maturing has helped me become a more effective communicator and leader in high school, and made me an independent and confident person."
"In a world that is increasingly interconnected and interdependent, developing a multifaceted view of the world and become an important skill. I am deeply interested in understanding the shifting of global power dynamics. Hence, I am excited to major in International Studies at Emory College of Arts and Science. I am especially looking forward to taking advantage of Emory University's outstanding political economy curriculum. Region-specific courses such as ""India: Challenges & Opportunities"" will deepen my understanding of the effects of economic liberalization on developing economics which is extremely crucial to understanding the ""Century of Asia"". I also anticipate participating in an array of special programs that Emory University offers, such as the Berlin Program in European Politics to fulfill my intellectual curiosity through hands-on learning. Political economy is the map of the world and Emory University is the plane that will take me to any point on the map."
"Debating was for winning. Debating could have also been for losing, for all I cared, but the point of arguing was to figure out what was right and wrong. Yet, despite however much I dissected and dismantled others' beliefs, some people were just never convinced, even after admitting they were drained of counterarguments. But what was the point of arguing if I could not change others' views? Then, it clicked. People, including me, tend to perceive information selectively, listening to what conforms to their beliefs. The point of debate is not to change others' beliefs, but to check my own thinking, to listen to others' perspectives and reasoning. With my new understanding, I am motivated to learn about our nuanced differences and develop skills to bridge differences. At Emory, I am ready to contribute my ideas and learn about others. I am ready to voice my opinions and facilitate discourse."
"Life in America seemed alluring - the intrinsic sense of personal freedom and global diversity as extolled by my seniors gave me valuable insights into the academic richness of the US higher educational system. While researching potential colleges and conferring with my friends who were already there, I learned that unlike the rigid and stratified educational system in India, colleges in the US focused instead on the holistic development and skill acquisition of students. My cloistered high school experiences here had not prepared me for the variegated life and cultural diversity I was expecting there. This inevitably led to a growing sense of formidable uncertainty which convinced me take a gap year, after graduating from high school, to appraise and introspect. The concept of 'gap year' is an alien concept to Indian society at large. The initial reaction of my parents was one of extreme scepticism and it took me hours to convince them that this was a necessary move to evaluate my academic and career options, before embarking on the next phase of my life. Thankfully, after much questioning they relented and became my most fervent supporters. So, in order to find a greater sense of purpose during this turbulent phase, my mind drifted to my experiences as a volunteer for blood donation camps in the nearby suburb of Naihati. Here, I frequently observed young boys playing barefoot football in a nearby unkempt playing field. I remember being struck by their tremendous football skills and innovative techniques despite not possessing the proper football gear. After conversing with them I gradually learned how they were all enrolled in a local government school, which they hardly attended; instead, they spent long hours out in the open fields honing their skills. My fleeting interactions with those boys had a searing impact on my psyche. After graduating from high school, I returned to Naihati and spent long hours practising with them. I was truly impressed because they possessed an innate ability to improvise and were entirely self-taught. Their obvious love for the game compelled me to provide them better opportunities to hone their burgeoning skills. Although I knew this was going to be a Herculean task, I decided to organize an impromptu football tournament. My parents thought I was being impulsive since I was unfamiliar with rural folk, local government authorities and bureaucratic tangles. However, their incessant criticism and discouragement only served to steel my resolve and sense of higher purpose. The following month, I, along with a few friends, met 12 school Principals and drummed up sufficient interest in our fledgling month-long tournament. At the culmination, two players from Naihati would be selected to train at a coaching club free of cost. Organizing a tournament on this scale was a daunting proposition and I was inundated with various responsibilities and was forced to take some fairly drastic decisions. This was especially true, when I had to personally meet leading advertising and marketing professionals to attract the necessary corporate sponsorship. Forging personal connections and disbursing funds prudently made me more cautious, worldly-wise and financially prudent. Being accountable to students, school administration and coaches alike, also taught me the importance of self-sufficiency, advanced planning and proper team selection. On the last day of the tournament, my father hugged me closely and praised my singular efforts towards the society, and more importantly, my personal development. Those weeks of unrelenting hard work had matured me as an individual and I felt imbued with sufficient confidence to address another challenge, namely, a competitive academic environment. Brimming with self-belief and feeling liberated I renewed my search for a summer internship at a financial institution. My internship experience has honed my intrinsic skill-set and served as the ideal launch-pad for a future career in finance, thereby enabling me to apply the benefits for the betterment of society at large."
"I have invariably believed that education should not be confined to the four walls of classroom. I believe in learning by doing: some of the most important lessons are learned by directly being involved and personally invested. I would like to be a part of such an academic environment that promotes empirical learning, unlike the education system I have been exposed to so far, where the curriculum limits our learning to the textbooks. Moreover, I am seeking a college campus, which facilitates balance between academics and co-curricular activities. In school, the emphasis was on hours spent studying for exams and rote learning. I, on the other hand, felt that one should always strive to achieve the ideal balance between academics and playtime, without compromising on either. I would like to further my knowledge and skills, while continuing to participate and excel in various co-curricular activities that I am interested in."
"As a five-year old, my mother's fickle behaviour of being insensitive and violent sometimes led me to blame myself for somehow triggering it. But, as I grew older, her behaviour became downright frightening and I began limiting our interactions while blaming her for all my problems. However, at age of 14, my father explained that she was suffering from Aggressive Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(AOCD) and her extreme mood swings was beyond her control. I was wracked with guilt for not having done enough over the years to empathize with her. I realized that not knowing limits one's perspective and misguides judgment. The more I learnt about my mother's condition, the better I communicated with her, which ultimately led to happiness around. My efforts to increase my general awareness led to better academic performance and improved relationships. She has motivated me to construe situations, explore circumstances, expand my horizons and keep learning."
"Skyscrapers. Grand cathedrals. Detailed statues. As impressive as they may be, the corner shop that gave you a discount for a loaf of bread is one to remember. Images in my memory lead me to retrospect a feature of the thought that is of personal significance. Yes, the Eiffel tower impressed but Paris is all about the restaurant I lost my phone charger in. Bradbys, with its symbolic purple colour and barbaric reputation, is more than a place of residence. Bradbys, feared by those outside, revered by those within; people mistake the everlasting festive spirit for nonchalance. But the facts and figures prove the unmatched productivity. We bulldoze through the most miserable of English days in the eagle-headed house. 5 years flew by at the hub. Fortunately, it's not over. We bleed purple. The sorting hat did a good job. Winston Churchill went to another boarding house but he wouldn't have made the cut for Bradbys anyway. Bradbys is an overflowing glass of banter and harmony. Harrow, my high school, was never short of fuel but without the spark, there is no fire. How proud I am to have been a constituent of the fire steel: Bradbys. I truly felt the potency of a collective unit during my time here. In my applications, I claim to seek great research environments and so on but frankly, I seek a place that will teach me to strive and prosper whilst enjoying every moment of it. It is going to take one heaven of a place to replace Bradbys in my life. Fanatic is an understatement to express my love for football (Soccer if you must). I must admit, Siena had some picturesque buildings and streets with a characteristic vintage brick colour but I swiftly led myself down a creepy alley to the Montepaschi Arena that looked not far from a ruin. The rundown stands presented to me the battle scars of an unstable club that fights constantly to stay standing. In parts of Europe, football carries a cultural relevance that matches the arts. Through visiting such arenas, I witness the blood, sweat and tears of a people who dedicate their weekends to attend competitive fixtures regardless of their restless schedule during the week. Thus, I inject myself with the spirit that inhabits the stadiums. However, my drive for academia was deficient of such injections of passion and livelihood. Seeking to occupy a section of my heart with academia, I browsed through my limited collection of literature from my childhood concerning the scholarly world. An old man naked outside a bath on the cover: a must-read. Archimedes' story, featuring his bathtub, gave me amusement rather than any academic significance more than a decade ago. Obliged to rack my brains for hours to find solutions to problems set for homework, I discovered that Archimedes solves a problem regarding nature by taking a lovely warm bath. Eureka! Quite simply, his studies covered every inch of his mind. The same way a teenager's room is covered in posters of his/her favourite band. Leaving valuable thoughts at the top of his head enabled his rigorous practice of science, even when tending to bodily needs. Thus, I took to my recreational love for fashion in discovering a love for textiles which inevitably fused with my interest in chemistry. Miracle: I was spending my free time searching the antibacterial and odour-repelling properties of silver when weaved into clothes and silver is found to even have a potential for wearable technology using its high conductivity to track the wearer's heart rate. Something ""academic"" in my free time. Exclamation after exclamation. Shout out to Archimedes. Our world consists of places and faces that form sketches of memories and concepts in our sophisticated minds. Therefore, I hope to gain more memories to cherish and ponder upon, at the destination of my physical and cerebral presence."
"Conformity seems to be a trend. The flair of our youth is oppressed by a tunnel vision towards an uprising phenomenon. Adults advise to search a path where potential looms. Becoming advanced and developed in fields is brilliant but there is a lack of vision for diverse options. The population all look to the same place for hope and ""success"". I have taken on board a traditional English stubbornness that solidified my belief of a marvellous life ahead of me that is not to be compared to that of others. Life is not assessed on success or even generosity and righteousness, in fact, life is not assessed at all. A failure to be conscious of the value of personal distinction and of the sheer strength of synergy created by variance leaves me frustrated at the thought of seeing an increasingly synchronised world."
"As some indie tune echoes and I shampoo my hair, I plot for a pen that doesn't require ink to write on paper. It is so gripping that I forget to brush my teeth. Personally, learning is not something I do just for pleasure. It is a stepping-stone. Planning for a venture or adventure comes with years of study from the basics to the fine details. The absorption of information leads to a greater good if in cohesion with a personal craving. I can sit at my desk for months and I won't take in a byte of information about politics. Learning is a natural process when trying to dig deeper into an idea. When I wanted to drive faster than 5 mph I learnt to switch gears. Because I want to make a fabric that does not need to be washed, I learn about the anti-bacterial property of silver."
"""Listen to Addo"", said, the Akan teacher, Mr. Oduro. Quickly, a hush fell over the class for they knew what was coming. Clutching my essay written in Akan tightly, I slowly stood up and started to read,"" Me name de Kwaku Addo..."" My mates burst into laughter as I read an Akan-English essay. They had no clue that the boy standing before them had spent thirty minutes trying to create that sentence. I'm sure the million-dollar question on your minds is ""How does a Ghanaian kid not know his own dialect?"" Yes, I am a Ghanaian born into a Ghanaian family. Although both of my parents could speak numerous Ghanaian languages, they trained us in English and Italian. We had planned to emigrate to Italy, where my father had already relocated to. Yet, the inevitable happened; my father passed away. All of our plans went down the drain. So Adobea, my twin sister, and I were in our home country with little knowledge of our native tongue. Visits to my hometown, a typical village, were analogous to diplomatic visits to a foreign country with my mum acting as a translator. When school started in kindergarten, we performed well academically. But we couldn't make friends since many of the pupils communicated in vernacular. Primary school was especially challenging for me; I had to study Akan as a core requirement. Even though we could choose any other language class, to me, all the offered languages sounded like the ones spoken in Star Wars. But I decided to put some effort into learning Akan, so that I could shatter the aura of invisibility that enshrouded me when I was around my peers. However, my attempts were scratches at best; my situation kept worsening. The instructor breezed through the basics of the language and by the third week, we were writing essays in Akan. Soon, I became the laughing stock of the class. Anytime I read my Akan essays, my mates would make fun of me. During final exams, my mates would cruise through and get A's while I struggled to get a B. In truth, these embarrassing episodes continued till I completed 9th grade. And after graduation, I still struggled to speak Akan, whereas Adobea mastered it. Back at home, my mother, still traumatized, did not want to communicate with us in vernacular Akan. ""If life throws hard-rock lemons at you, pick them up and make lemon juice"" was my mantra when I decided to become skilled in two languages in high school. As a student attending one of the best boarding high schools in Ghana, I was exposed to diverse groups of students from all over Ghana. So I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to study two languages via first-hand experience. With determination, I mastered two dialects: Buem and Akan. And at the end of a beautiful high school experience, I began to understand and appreciate my culture even more. Also, after effectively interacting with a diverse group of students, I laid the foundation to enable me work in a global society. Now, I can visit my hometown and talk freely with my cousins and listen to the stories I missed as a child. Sometimes it feels weird to hear that little voice in my head speak in Akan and Buem. But it's a nice sensation. I refuse to be held back by certain mishaps and obstacles.Through this experience, I have evolved into a resilient person who believes that ""success is a journey; persistence is the vehicle you drive in"". Thus said, I can proudly say my name in a local dialect - ""Me din de Nana Kwaku Addo Adjedu""."
Global warming. Curbing the effects of global warming is not challenging; the significant challenge is convincing the public that global warming is a major social problem.
"Once I accepted my situation (difficult) empowerment followed. Each time I see tears flow down my mother's cheeks anytime we can't afford to meet our expenses, I burn. I burn with the desire to wipe her tears. Thus, anytime I feel unmotivated to a pick a book to study, I open my wallet to look at a photo of her. And like magic, I become refueled with fresh motivation. The struggle of how my mum strove to raise up her two children alone is just so motivational. She has made so many sacrifices that have enabled me pursue my aspirations and I hope to impart the same value everywhere I set foot. Therefore, with this impetus I would like to turn her tears into laughter the day I come home as a mathematician."
"Monday was cardboard-crusted pizza, sprinkled with expired parmesan. Tuesday was meat mash. Wednesday was dry, flaky oatmeal. Day after day, the Phillips Exeter Academy cafeteria served various unappealing options. Mark Twain once said ""The secret of success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside."" Yet, it felt like my fight was with the cafeteria. After a day of hard work, I felt we deserved a satisfying meal to assuage our stress. However, I was consistently left frustrated by the lack of diversity in food options at the cafeteria; options that were usually microwaved straight out the freezer. I hoped the situation would eventually change, but to no avail it remained the same. My peers and I saw the need to challenge the status quo and address this important student concern. Thus, we created Swyft, a food delivery service, with offerings ranging from Starbucks to McDonald's to a Mexican grill downtown. Our main agenda was to provide exceptional customer satisfaction and to improve the food options available to students. On our journey to resolve the issue, we faced some challenges. First, we presented our fairly simple business plan to the Students Activities Center, expecting to gain approval immediately. Instead, they were highly critical of our abilities, worrying that our school workload might cause the club to fail and that there weren't enough members to sustain the intensity of a delivery business. Admittedly, they had reason. Our numbers were few, and we were going to be directly competing with local restaurants' delivery services. However, they were not aware of how driven a crowd of young, hungry, and dissatisfied students could be. To address these concerns, we set out to recruit more people through survey inquiries and student council debates and were able to attract interest in our entrepreneurial mission. Our growing support prompted the Student Activities Center to revoke their earlier decision, and by the start of my junior year, operations had commenced. However, the hardest part was yet to come. As operations manager, I was responsible for meticulously chauffeuring items to their eager customer after the food was picked up. It wasn't easy. Food items would either get left behind at restaurants, become stale on the car ride over, or become cold sitting at our office space. Such misgivings had an effect on the intensity of our business; our client base decreased within three weeks after business commenced. Our main mission, customer satisfaction, was being compromised, and I knew I had to make a change to our business operations. My first action was to streamline the club's sloppy operational model to save our ambitious business. As such, I created a detailed information sheet containing food items ordered, cost, and the dorm in which the customer lived in order to shorten the time frame between the restaurant and the customer's mouth. I replaced previous small paper bags with insulated ones to better conserve food temperature, and started holding drivers more accountable for picking up their items. Although the changes did not ignite the customer boom we had seen at the start of operations, we saw a positive turnaround in our user base. As such, our frustration with our efficiency lead us to improve our operations mechanisms, thereby becoming a better service provider to the student body. I had the luxury of growing with this club and enjoying a unique opportunity to challenge an issue and achieve greatness with my friends. I developed an innovative spirit while working my position and was able to tackle forthcoming issues with inventive solutions. My experience also showcased that, through creative efforts, students are able to make substantial changes despite bureaucratic obstacles. As such, my growing adoration for entrepreneurship has forever fostered in me a commitment to provide service and satisfaction to my community, regardless of the scale of the issue at hand."
"At the heart of my excitement for college is the opportunity to experience a broad liberal arts education while indulging in hands-on interactive programs. Emory has an exceptional economics program; prominent courses such as The Economics of Life will be pivotal to understanding global economic decisions. In addition, the breath of Emory's academic curricula, from renowned electives to freshman seminars, will sharpen my mind via critical thinking, intellectual conversation, and deep inquiry. Additionally, I am excited to carve my niche amongst a multi-talented student body through campus life programs and community service. Having spent years teaching children soccer, my passion for community service resonates with Emory's mission to act as an agent of change. Overall, Emory will provide me with both breadth and depth of knowledge, while molding me into a multi-faceted and altruistic citizen of the world."
"For most of my life, I lived in a scrawny city named Lagos. Mornings were tainted by unpaved roads and chaotic car traffic, and nights were filled with mischief and street-side beggars. At home, I tended to my homework by dim candlelight. The Nigerian government had allocated few resources to education or public infrastructure, leaving few opportunities for academic excellence and over half the country brewing in darkness. After experiencing the depths of these conditions, I am motivated to become a vehicle for change within Nigeria through a passionate interest in economics. Over the years, I have developed my keen interest via various ventures, including Swyft, an internship at Cordros Capital Limited, and several academic courses. Thus far, I've gained basic knowledge in financial economics and funds management, and I'm extremely motivated to pursue this passion and forge a path to illuminate the prospects of future generations of African children."
"#ImpactThatMatters Almost a year has gone by... I stare confidently at the mirror and ask myself, ""what has changed really?"" Fixing my tie and putting on my suit jacket, I give a small smirk and convince myself, ""Everything has changed!"" February 1st 2016 was probably the happiest day of my life as I signed the contract avowing that I will be joining Deloitte Audit during my gap year. But sadly, expectation did not meet reality and all this excitement was short-lived. Last year, I was the Deputy Headboy of a school in charge of over six hundred boys and all of a sudden I found myself sitting on the uttermost part of the junior table making tea for my seniors. Just as I thought things couldn't get any worse, deadline clients began and sections had to be delivered. I remember staring at my watch one night; ""02:43am"" read the display as I sat there trying to close one review note or 'corrections' as they are jokingly referred to in the office. Extremely fatigued, I found myself querying if that's what Thomas Edison meant when he said 'great opportunities come dressed in overalls and look like work!"" This time it came in the form of a Cost of Sales section and it definitely didn't feel great. With my pride taking such huge knocks, I felt defeated and my ensuing instinct was to throw in the towel. One afternoon, I was in conversation with my immediate manager, Isaiah Nyathi, who explained how seven years ago he was in my shoes ready to quit but he kept at it. As I kept listening, rays of hope poured in and realizations emerged. Whatever excuse I could have given for wanting to quit my job, whether valid or not, would have deprived me of a chance to learn from the brightest business minds in the country. At that juncture, quitting stopped appearing on my to-do-list as Napoleon Hill's words ""effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit,"" became testament to me. As my attitude towards the work changed, I began to enjoy auditing. Day-in, day-out my skills as a professional were honed. From debating in pre-engagement meetings with the Audit Partner to understanding and critiquing the business processes of large organisations to being in secluded towns for weeks in small teams, Deloitte has taught me how to handle pressure and the essence of teamwork. Delving into the unexpected, critical thinking became the norm. Deloitte's solution based audit has taught me not to look at problems just as problems but as opportunities to create new and better situations altogether thus making an #ImpactThatMatters as per the Deloitte mission statement. As this principle enveloped my life, I took the office to the community. I introduced a new accounting software and controls at my church and which has brought financial transparency to the congregation. Although making it into Deloitte was an accomplishment on its own, my greatest accomplishment this year is making it through first year audit articles. I've grown to learn that temporary defeat is an inevitable fate we all face at one point or another. But more importantly, its how we respond to it that matters because our choices are the only devices we can control. Everyday, I see the statement #ImpactThatMatters by our office entrance and I'm reminded of the values Deloitte has instilled in me which I now impart to the new group of audit interns. Had I given up, this is an opportunity I would have stolen from them and I would not be putting this story to paper. Who knows, if Thomas Edison had given up on his first try, the world might still be a dark place. Sometimes refusing to quit may light up the world and continue to make an #ImpactThatMatters!"
"Gender Equality Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Gender Equality is the view that everyone should receive equal treatment and not be discriminated against based on their gender. As I ponder on this definition, I wonder where the 21st Century boy or man fits in there. Seldom do you hear that in the definition of Gender Empowerment, men are included. The turn of the new age has seen the neglect of the boy child, being abandoned on the way-side as we praise the girl child. Slowly, but surely, the message of equality has been lost. In our aim to correct the wrongs of a patriarchal society, we have bred yet another devil, a society that does not listen to the cry of the boy child and the man. In 50 years time, gender equality will still be a prominent issue, just a different gender!"
"Poem: A Different History (Sujata Bhatt) - Growing up in a post-colonial era in a Commonwealth nation I could relate to every word in the second stanza. Over a century ago, English was the oppressor's language but today English is more than just a language, it has become my language and allows me to put this essay to paper. As many might say English is the oppressor's language - the dynamism of culture has created a whole new Zimbabwean story 36 years after independence. The 21st Century African culture is one that has engulfed us as the 'unborn grandchildren,' whether white, black or mixed, Shona, Ndebele or Khalanga into one culture, the modern culture. Culture evolves and we are who we are because of the cultural diversity and value that each and every individual brings into this newly knitted society we now breathe and love."
"It's done. I glanced at the front page, then flipped the book to its spine. This was the moment I was waiting for, a published book the way I wanted it to be. My joy was overwhelming, and in awe, I looked through the pages again, taking in the details. Writing has always been my hobby. Science fiction and fantasy are my usual genres, but three years ago, I decided to try writing a novel based on social reality. During my search, I found that LGBTQ-themed topics are underrepresented in Chinese literature. I decided to base my novel on this theme, and hoping for honest critique, I shared the novel's progress online. As I researched more about LGBTQ-related topics for the novel's accuracy, I was deeply affected by what I read. Having a different sexuality is not an illness, but many still view homosexuality as a psychological disorder in need of clinical treatment. Even the Chinese legal system turns a blind eye to these cases, depriving individuals of much-needed advocacy. Driven by compassion, I gave my novel a peaceful closure, rather than its originally tragic ending. I didn't realize the impact of my action until one reader personally messaged me online. She expressed her gratitude for the novel's happy ending, and how much my work had brought her hope. When she asked if I could publish my novel, I was so surprised I nearly fell to the floor. I had no idea that my work mattered to someone that much, and I wanted to honor her request. Writing the novel inadvertently stirred a sense of activism in me. Publishing would take my activism one step further; if a published book would allow more people to take the subject seriously, it was worth it. So I started from scratch. Self-publishing in itself was a form of education, a task more intensive than writing. Contacting a publisher and scouting for a printing factory were actually the easy parts. What came next required Herculean effort: following up, checking in, and supervising the whole process from beginning to end. I knew I could be a hands-off author and wait for the results, but I was determined to be on the front lines. I would contact my publisher until late at night, bothering her with questions from about typesetting to the smallest details like a page number's design. Once we even spent three days trying to decide a font for the title, finally compromising on our differing opinions. Remembering the encouraging comments from my readers, I was more determined than ever to get the aesthetic right. After all, this was their story. When the book finally came out, a sense of amazement and achievement rushed down to my heart. The book, however, means more than a great accomplishment to me; it is also a thank-you letter to my LGBTQ readers as part of my small contribution. I hoped my book would help more people view and understand the LGBTQ community with empathy, and it did. Readers of all identities shared their enthusiasm for both the story's realism and the book's print design. Their response illuminated my way ahead: writing is now an indispensable part of my life. I will keep telling stories as a form of activism, and using my pen as a mighty weapon, keep writing until the world listens."
"Thanks to the speed of technology nowadays, my generation not only has the privilege of access to all kinds of new information and also the opportunity to work and live longer. Our generation marches to the drum of ""faster, better, and more"" so that we never know when it is time to let go. But increased longevity does not always give rise to increased happiness and self-fulfillment. We are the generation that is literally working around the clock, beating our parents who lived by the 9-5 apple-pie rhythm of life, and aimlessly testing the unimaginable limitation of ourselves. This blind but progressive march into the future is a challenge that not only consumes time, energy, and wasted resources but will also become an extensive worrying issue for this generation and the next."
"My writing ususally starts after reading storiea that cannot satisfy my needs; I organize volunteer activities as the one I participated in previously has not done enough; I jump into school teams for various events and competitions when our predecessors produced mediocre results. A wise friend used to tell me she sees my motivation for everything, learning included, comes from my dissatisfaction with reality and desire to take meaningful action. Indeed, in that way I am motivated to learn, also because I want to make a change. To be more specific, I wish to pursue biochemistry thoroughly and full-heartedly as I long to use my knowledge to help develop solutions for malicious diseases that are currently unsolvable. Contributing my efforts to help ease people's suffering, this motivation has been my mast since I started the sail in this field of study, and it always keeps me going."
"My family lives in fear. Fear of a tyrant known as my father. It didn't used to be this way. Sometimes if I close my eyes and concentrate really hard I can remember a time when my father didn't hurl threats and insults at my mother, when I didn't get bruises for speaking out of turn or protecting my mom, when my sisters' screams didn't wake me up at night. I remember a family outing, all five of us going to the beach in our minivan. I can feel my father's hand ruffle my hair, and see his eyes crinkle into a warm smile. He doesn't smile anymore. Sometimes I don't even want to call him my father. You could say that my family situation left me little envious of other people. Normal people. It also left me unaware of social norms. I found it hard to fit in, especially when the other kids started talking about family vacations and the awesome things their parents do for them. Me? I counted myself lucky if I didn't see plates thrown around the house. I found it hard to make friends, but I'd read somewhere that being confident and outgoing can make it easier. With my lack of social graces, I took this to heart and started acting out, playing the class clown to get attention. For a while I was happy. Everybody saw me. They laughed every time I played pranks or told jokes (Why isn't your nose 12 inches long? Because then it'd be a foot). It took me a while to realize that they weren't laughing with me - they were laughing at me. And that hurt. Eventually, as I grew older, I made new friends. There was still a distance between us though. I didn't talk about my family (Abusive father? Real conversation killer). I didn't feel like laying my problems at their feet, so I acted happy and carefree, even when I felt like lying face-down on my bed all day. I must be a good actor, because they never caught onto my fake laughs. Or maybe they just didn't care. They changed their tune awfully fast when I started paying more attention to my studies than their drunken escapades after all. One thing led to another, and eventually I was told that my 'friends' didn't want me in their group anymore. I was too boring. Too much of a geek. I was okay with that though. I'd found a real friend. I'd never really thought I'd find somebody who got me. I found two. One became my best friend. The other I fell head over heels in love with. I could finally be myself around actual people. Nobody would laugh when I started talking about how cool it is that time slows down around a black hole or how amazing it is that virtual reality is now officially available to the general public. Nobody would scoff at me when I tried to talk about anime or video games. No more masks, no more fake personas. I felt like I was a caged bird who had managed to open the lock to its prison with its beak. I felt like I'd been living my whole life blindfolded, and now I could finally see. I felt.... liberated. And it felt amazing."
"Paradise Lost is a book I remember quite vividly. The graphic description of the sheer atrocities that humans can commit still horrifies me. Yet, within that same book lies the stories of heroes who risked everything they had to save complete strangers. This dichotomy defines human nature - we are forever at war with ourselves, dark and light, yin and yang. I carry the memories of what happened in those pages everywhere I go, so that I remember who to emulate and what I must never allow myself to become."
"I've always needed to know how things work. The inner workings of toys and clocks. The hardware inside a computer. The code behind software that performs miracles. This incessant need has been with me my whole life, perching on my shoulder like a guardian angel, leading me to uncover the secrets behind everything I can lay eyes on. That is why I want to learn as much as I can. Knowledge and information can turn the tides of war and create utopia out of armageddon. It is only common sense to pursue it to my limits and beyond."
"If you were to flip through my playlists, you would not simply find a group of random songs, but an anthology of memories. There is the classical music that woke me from naps along with my mom's favorite 90's music for afternoon dance parties, while the sunlight made patterns upon the living room floor. Flashes of memory from when I played my very first violin piece, and my mom's proud expression, recalling that her college roommates were musicians. Hot summer days spent watching the Voice together on the TV in her room, as she excitedly pointed out artists she loved and songs that brought tears to her eyes, realizing she had not heard them since her own schooldays. Then fast forward through evenings crowded onto her bed, listening together to songs her friends sent to remind her to be brave as cancer took over and she was overcome with pain. Scrolling through Spotify, time ticks ahead. I'm playing the violin again, Massenet's ""Meditation"" from Thais, this time in the hospital, knowing that although my mom is too sick to move or even speak, she is still listening. It's one of her final days, the last Mother's Day we will spend together. Then suddenly, there are tears on every face, and the live funeral band is playing ""Auld Lang Syne"", as if it's New Year's. I find it odd, but soon realize it actually fits: a mark of the passage of time, the end of one part of my life, and the beginning of another, the chance to make new resolutions. In those last days, my grandfather spoke to me about independence, explaining that as the older sister, I would need to take responsibility for my brother and myself. As he spoke, pop music played from a radio in the background, and I found the sound strangely refreshing, a reminder that around me, life goes on. I didn't really need the lecture. Since my mom became confined to her bed, I couldn't rely on her help and had to learn to make my own decisions. I found what it means to be self-sufficient, from small things like remembering to take my vitamins in the morning, to bigger things, like supporting my brother as he navigates high school as my mom supported me. I did not want to give my mom more stress in a difficult time, and that helped me gain the confidence to accomplish things by myself. I accept that I no longer have the same kind of support to fall back on that I had relied on for many years. At the same time, it is not always easy to be confident. Sometimes, when I feel most alone, I go to my mom's favorite playlists and draw strength from the memories. The strength that she gained from listening to those lyrics while she was ill passes into me. When I hear snatches of her songs, I'm reminded that if she could have confidence in me, I can trust myself as well. My mother was not just a parent, but my best friend and role model, and she will always inspire me. Music is a window into another time and place, and recognizing its effect on myself, I know that it can transport others into a different world as well. Bringing that joy to others is a small way of sharing my mom's legacy and her impact on my life. I choose to be a daughter she could be proud of - an individual shaped by my own environment and unique experiences but heavily influenced by our many shared memories. I hope that somewhere out there, my mom can look on and smile."
"Any issue facing my generation is one that the entire world faces. Although it is the 21st century, women still often face discrimination. It is clearly documented that women have difficulty attaining high-level positions and suffer sexism in a many ways, particularly in STEM fields. In my own life, I have already experienced this inequality, seeing boys shout down girls' opinions in my computer science class, only to realize later that the girls were correct and often more capable at handling the work. I am trying to help combat the issue in my own small ways. One example is my involvement with my school's Women in STEM conference, which invites accomplished women to speak about their experiences and give advice to girls from around the tristate area. This community offers role models and support to girls interested in STEM fields, changing the world one step at a time."
"Soon after my mom passed away, I read a book called The Dalai Lama's Cat. It is a fictional work that humorously illustrates the day-to-day life of a cat trying to live by Buddhist philosophy. It really struck a chord with me, as my family is Buddhist, and during my mom's illness, she became more spiritual. Perhaps during difficult periods of life, people discover what is most important to their lives, beyond material concerns. Buddhism's core principles are not religious in nature, but instead concerned with happiness and living life to the fullest, so they are relevant to anyone regardless of religion. One of my favorite messages is that you cannot control what happens to you, only your reaction to it, and living by this principle has improved my life. Reading this book helped me understand why Buddhism was so important in my mom's last few months."
"In the summer of 2015, my childhood friend Henry was losing his battle with cancer and my younger brother Christopher was fighting late-stage Lyme disease. I had just begun a work-study project at Children's National Medical Center and was having a difficult time becoming invested in the seemingly esoteric research project. Henry remained at the back of my mind, and I kept up with his daily progress and treatment through the CaringBridge site his parents created. When I visited him in August of 2015, the reality of his situation hit me hard. Reading about his progress online had allowed me a level of delusion about the seriousness of his condition that vanished when I saw him in person. He barely had enough energy to smile at me as I commented on the baseball game we were watching, the machine filtering his blood through yards of plastic tubing humming in the background. Henry died that October, just as I was settling back into school and adjusting to my new status as a senior. It seemed unreal. Watching Henry and Christopher struggle with their illnesses made me approach my research with a new perspective. The lab I am a member of is investigating the effects of the chemical DEHP, a major component in many plastic medical devices including plastic tubing. Henry underwent dialysis because his kidneys were too diseased to filter his blood. Christopher had a plastic indwelling infusion line (PICC line) implanted in his arm for two months to receive drug therapy. Both boys had the potential for very high levels of exposure to the chemical DEHP. My lab is researching DEHP's provocative effect on the development of dangerous heart conditions and states of physiological stress high enough to hamper the heart's ability to adjust to the body's needs. Sometimes patients like Henry and my brother battle not only the diseases that plague them, but are also exposed to hazardous and unregulated levels of chemicals in the very devices that deliver their treatment. Henry cherished the tablespoon of water he was still able to consume on his own. Christopher refused to leave the house without the protective sleeve he could wear over his arm to hide his PICC line. For patients who don't have much to look forward to, everything counts. Imagine a young patient defeats cancer, but develops a heart condition from his treatment and must now spend the rest of his life in and out of doctors' offices. This result could have easily been avoided had the proper research been conducted when such treatments were designed. I have been working on this problem and learning more about it in order to assist Dr. Nikki Posnack, the head of our lab, in her complex research and data analysis to assess the harmful nature of DEHP. This evidence is crucial to more effectively campaign against the use of such chemicals in patient care and to advocate for federal regulation and safer alternatives. When I started in the Posnack lab at the age of 16, knowing I wanted to be a physician, I saw research as an obligatory component of any science student's application. It wasn't until I experienced firsthand the impact and application of such research that I became passionate about it. That realization drove me to work through my senior year and to delay my academic career to continue in the lab now. My experience in the lab has transformed the plans I had for my future. There is a continuous need to improve patient care and endless problems to solve, and research is the way to find solutions. I have always been passionate about learning, especially science, but through my research investigations I discovered an outlet for my curiosity I had never imagined."
"While on EMT duty, I responded to a 911 call and found a young man lying dead in his bathtub. From a quick police investigation it was soon discovered he was an immigrant and had been denied citizenship numerous times. Was this rejection why he took his life? This case brought poignantly to mind one of the greatest challenges facing America today: lack of acceptance of the other. In our current political and cultural climate, rejection of immigrants is an especially serious problem. As an EMT, I engage strangers in a very intimate way. Barriers break down rapidly, and frequently a personal bond forms that builds empathy. This experience has taught me the most effective means of community building is through person-to-person relationships. I believe we all, and my generation in particular, have an obligation to strengthen America's communities by seeking to understand our neighbors and building trust among strangers."
"I am excited for all the things I cannot predict. I am excited to make mistakes, to discover academic areas I had no idea I would be interested in. I am excited to meet people with perspectives drastically different from my own, to be proven wrong, to have my opinion of something change. I am excited to take courses that make me think differently and approach knowledge in a new way. I am excited to continue studying subjects I know I love, like Chemistry and Art. I am excited to discover the culture of a new place, to see how I fare with a new level of independence. Most of all, I am excited to become a member of a community like Emory, to be surrounded by people different from myself in their beliefs and experiences, but similar in their passion for knowledge and desire to improve themselves through education."
"I stood at the front of the room frozen: mouth shut, palms sweating, body shaking. I looked around and saw two hundred pairs of eyes staring right at me and felt a pit in my stomach. I could almost hear the silence in the room as I took my final step towards the podium to begin speaking. Each girl was eagerly looking at me, waiting to hear what I had to say. I was the focus and I was terrified. Slowly, I forced my mouth open and began my speech for vice president of judaism (sh'licha) for North Carolina Council of the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization. I hurriedly stuttered my way through the speech and finally it was over. The voting began, and until the winner was announced I was in a blur. I trudged back into the main room, expecting to hear the worst. I did, and I was devastated. Arriving home after the loss, I felt worthless. I questioned my involvement in BBYO and if I wanted to continue in the organization in the future. This doubt quickly ended, though, when I received a call from the recently elected president, Marissa Uri. She told me that she was proud of my effort and that she thought I would be a great candidate for the position of vice president of membership (morah) for the following year. I couldn't believe that someone, especially the president, noticed me and took the time to contact me. I quickly reached for my computer and began looking at the duties of the membership vice president. It was still a year away, but I couldn't wait to start brainstorming ideas so I dove right in. Looking through past speeches and goals, I spent hours each day crafting new and improved lists of what I wanted to accomplish, if elected for the following year. Because I became so invested in the position, I didn't realize how quickly time was flying by; from May to September to March the days felt like seconds and finally it was April 10, 2016-election day. As the elections were about to start, I took a deep breath and remembered the words Marissa had said to me the year before. I couldn't wait to share my ideas with each of the two hundred members in the crowd. My mouth opened and the words flowed like lava. As the voting commenced, my heart was pounding, but I felt confident. I imagined what it would be like if I won when suddenly I heard my name announced. I looked around, then glanced at Marissa from across the room, and she nodded. This was real; I won. A rush came over me as I shed tears of joy and hugged my friend sitting next to me. I could hardly believe it but it was true; I was the 26th Morah of North Carolina. Since that day, I have been repeating that moment in my head as a reminder of how excited I was when I finally accomplished my goal. Doing this reminds me of how people believe in me and why I should believe in myself. Whenever I lose motivation or feel down, that feeling picks me back up and inspires me to keep going. Without winning this position, I wouldn't be where I am today. It made me more passionate, more confident, and more determined than ever before."
"It is my first day. I walk outside into a sea of people gathered on the quad, just talking and having fun. As I walk over, people I've never met before run up to greet me. Everyone is so friendly and genuinely interested in getting to know each other. As I continue to walk around, I see people of all different races and religions. Being biracial myself, a diverse campus is something that is crucial to my happiness and comfortability on campus. Next, I head to my first class. Although it is a large lecture class, the professor wants to know everyone's names. The class is engaging and challenging; it is hard enough to get me critically thinking and deeply engaged in the topic. I realize that I will make invaluable friendships and gain a priceless education; I wouldn't want anything else."
"My motivation to learn comes from within. I have an intrinsic desire to learn about all topics and always dig deeper to find out new information. Unlike some kids whose parents have to push them to do things, I push myself to take on every opportunity. Each summer, I participate in educational programs. I want to know more about the world and experience things for myself. By having these unique experiences, I am able to learn so much about interesting topics. For example, last summer I attended a program at Princeton where I took a class on biopsychology. I learned so much about the brain and neuroscience that I decided that it was something that I am interested in discovering more about. I was curious in finding out more, so I searched for opportunities and landed an internship with a neurosurgeon for two weeks."
"My dad experienced a great financial loss in his business about 3 years ago, which affected and changed our lives drastically. My dad's business was in Dubai and Karachi so he used to travel a lot. One day when my dad came back from Karachi, he seemed different. One night shortly after, my mom told me to pack a suitcase, we are leaving. I had no idea where we were going until I got my boarding pass which said TO: LOS ANGELES, CA. During that flight, my mom told me what was happening. A lot of people were blaming dad for a huge financial loss in the business. Even though everyone agreed in the deal and knew it was a risk. The safest option for us was to leave the country and go to America because a lot of very powerful people in Pakistan were looking for my dad and were threatening to hurt us. During that flight, my transition from childhood to adulthood began. I reflected on everything. I prayed a lot, and a thought came to me: life is meant to come with difficulties, a life without problems is a boring one. This has become a motto for me and so I just thanked God for having a family and prayed to keep them safe. Three months later, we went back to Dubai. Shortly after arriving, my mom told me that Dad will be staying at a friends' place for a few days. I knew she was lying and something was wrong, she finally told me with tears in her eyes that dad was in prison, sentenced for two years. His crime? He signed a blank check under pressure from the bad, powerful people who were in Pakistan's biggest political parties. That was the worst day of my life. I wanted to accompany my mom when she visited him, but he didn't want his children to see him in that hell. All the kids at the mosque, used to whisper when I passed, ""Oh did you hear, Inaara's dad is in jail?"". I hit rock bottom. It's hard to explain how I felt, but one thing I didn't feel was embarrassment. I was never ashamed of my dad. The entire world blamed my dad, but I knew that he didn't do anything wrong. I am who I am today because of him. This was a defining moment in my life, because I could no longer be the careless child that I was. It was time to grow up, take responsibility and be a contributing member in the family. I decided that I was going to work twice as hard in school, try to never let my parents down, to stay out of trouble, so that they would have one less thing to worry about. Eight months passed, he missed my 16th birthday, and I was just counting days. Maybe God finally heard us, someone helped us by giving money to bail him out of jail. He finally came home after 10 months. As soon as he walked through the door, I hugged him really tight and ran out the door. Ran to the mosque, sat in a corner quietly and just thanked God for bringing him home safe. A few months later, dad said it was time to start a new life and move to America. We came to Memphis. He enrolled me at Lausanne, because he didn't want to compromise my education under any circumstances. He works two jobs, I work too, to help with the bills. Even after everything he has been through, he has a smile on his face every morning. This entire experience made me stronger and taught me a lot, I am never scared of an obstacle or a hurdle anymore because life is full of problems and every problem has a solution, some are just harder to find."
"I'm looking forward to a class in which intellectual discussions take place, where we discuss the nephron in the kidney, and come up with a solution for dialysis. When I graduate, I don't want to be the richest, or prettiest one in the room but I definitely want to be the smartest one, and that is exactly why Emory is the place for me. Each classroom will be full of great minds, and that is what makes it tougher to be the best from the best. Living in a city like Atlanta, unlike living in a suburb in Memphis, where everyone knows everyone, allows you to meet strangers, learn new stories and struggles everyday. I visited Emory during the summer and I love the rush of Atlanta, everyone moving at a fast pace, trying to get places. Sounds like me, I'm hardly ever home, always running errands here and there."
"My favorite fiction television show is Greys Anatomy. One of the most prominent characters in the show is of Dr. Cristina Yang, who has influenced me the most. I know that this might sound very generic, or I might sound like a Netflix addict (which I can be during the summer). I was truly inspired by her attitude and courage. In an episode once, she said ""Oh screw beautiful, if you want to appease me compliment my brain."" That is my senior quote too. People need to start complimenting each other based on their actions, personality and talent and not based on money and looks. Dr. Yang has her priorities straight, and I aspire to be like her. ""There comes a point where it all becomes too much. So we give up. That's when the real work begins. To find hope where there seems to be absolutely none at all."""
"As I try my best not to get bored while reading Heart of Darkness, I overhear many angry voices shouting downstairs outside my apartment complex. What is it again this time? I really hope they can settle this peacefully. Oh yeah, on that note, where would be good places to escape/hide just in case this turn into a gunfight? Maybe the window? Such is the reality of living in the ""African-American section"" of the county. Right there in the flickering lights of the argument, the stark marks of poverty couldn't be clearer. Montgomery County is one of the richest counties in America, yet even here, poverty reigns just like anywhere else. Of course, my neighborhood is only a microcosm of the situation across America. The kids who I play basketball with in my neighborhood have no time for colleges and education, they are engulfed in the sex and the drugs that are rampant in Takoma. Gambling and mysterious substances transactions are common on the sidelines of the basketball courts. There have been times when I woke up from a deep sleep at 2 AM to angry voices shouting from under my apartment. There have been times when I came home to the sight of my neighbors being arrested. Witnessing these things, I can't help but wonder how much truth is still in the ""Land of Opportunity"" moniker and the ""rags-to-riches"" promise of America. Compare my neighbors to my friends in the magnet program at my high school, and one sees a huge chasm between kids who are separated by only 10 to 20 miles. My friends have never had to worry about foods and safety as they have lived in very sheltered homes. Some of them try drugs now and then, but it is always for fun, and never because they are addicted. Some of them also play basketball, but it is always for entertainment, and never to escape the rough reality of their lives. The biggest worry for my friends might be an upcoming piano recital, or perhaps an important sports game. Of course the gap between my friends and neighbors is only a small slice of the rich-poor divide. Back in Vietnam, my home country, there are kids who die of starvation while biking their daily 20-miles trip to school, or teenagers who have to cross dangerous running rivers by ziplining. I still remember how, on a visit to my uncle, my family simply gave milk to my cousins as a present, but they were ecstatic with this gift. Coming from such a country, I often wonder what have I done to deserve this much better life in America. I often feel so powerless to change the poverty that is so ingrained in my environment and in my identity. How can I help when I personally have many bedbug bites all over my body, when I too live with the fear that any common arguments in my neighborhood can quickly turn deadly? How can I help when I, too, am trapped in this same poverty, even though my intelligence and academics are as good as my upper-class friends? An old Chinese myth tells how carps can become dragons by jumping over the Dragon Gate of the Yellow River. Maybe if given the chance and the help needed, the ""carps"" in my neighborhood and in my home country of Vietnam could also become ""dragons""; but first, they must survive the trip before they can jump for immortality. I want to help them make that trip, but first I myself must be able to leave the cave I'm in. Thus, I keep doing everything I can, so that one day I can go back inside the cave that is my neighborhood and my home country and let them know that it is possible to leave; if I have to, I'll drag these people out into the sunlight, one by one."
"One of my favorite poem ever is one called Annabel Lee by Edgar Allen Poe. In fact, I really like most of Poe's poems, but this one stands out the most to me despite not being his most well-known one. The thing that I love the most about the poem is the way that the rhymes just roll of my tongue as I read it. Poe is perhaps the best poet at making his poems really lyrical and beautiful to listen to. In addition, though the poem rhymes beautifully, the content of the poem is a haunting sadness, creating a memorable contrast for me. Phrases such as ""chilling and killing"" and ""for the moon never beams, without carrying me dreams"" carry with them a terrible sadness woven with chilling beautiful rhymes. The main story of the poem matches this contrast, a beautiful love story that is lost forever."
"After finding the information I needed from the mitochondria Wikipedia page, the hyperlink ""Citric Acid Cycle"" caught my eye. Thinking why not, I clicked on the link. Before I can stop myself, I found myself browsing through the Wikipedia pages on allosteric inhibition, coenzymes, etc. By the time I checked the time, it was more than 90 minutes later. I have an inherent curiosity to know and learn more. This is why I often lose myself surfing through Wikipedia. I would often go to the site intending to look up only some specific topic, and would find myself reading many other topics in the process. Ideally, I'm a perfectionist, thus I want to know everything about every subject, but since this isn't possible, I have to settle for knowing as much as I can by continually reading and researching about different things that I find interesting."
"It was the final match of the street cricket tournament. Three runs were required to win, with one ball left in the game. My face was drenched in sweat to such an extent that it began to pour into my eyes. However, my minute focus on the ball was so strong that the burning sensation couldn't even make me blink. The 6 feet tall, fast-bowling, macho began his run-up to deliver the ultimate bowl with ferocity I had never witnessed before. This did not faze me, though. He bowled a searing outswinger, but I managed to caress it well enough to help it reach the boundary and earn four runs. I had won us the game. My teammates came running to me with such vigor and radiance, that almost suggested that I had saved their lives. As they lifted me on their shoulders and gave me a victory lap, my mind couldn't help but wander off to the distant past, when this accomplishment would've made no sense. I used to hate cricket. Yes, I was an anomaly in the world's sixth most populated country, where cricket is viewed almost as a religion. I just could not understand what all the hype was about. Why did people enjoy watching grown-up men trying to hit a ball with a wood-stick? Whenever my brother put it up in that one TV we had in my mom's room when I was a kid, I'd just wander off to my imaginary land where I was the Pokemon Master. The change occurred when I was 11-years-old. My brothers were playing in the driveway, and I came outside, after having an argument with my mom over getting me the latest Beyblade(a toy). Agitated, and looking for a diversion, I asked my brother to let me play a few shots. Here, I had found a release. The crisp sound coming off of my bat after smashing a delivery perfectly, filled me such comfort that I forgot all about the ""Gordian knot"" I believed I was facing. The habitual stress-releasing turned cricket into a hobby for me. I grew to appreciate it even more, as I began to realize how it seamlessly resonated with other aspects of my life. Ask anyone: I am a defensive player. I began trying to smash every delivery when I played to calm myself. But, as cricket became inveterate, my approach towards it transformed. Naturally, I started playing slowly, fending off most deliveries by dead-blocking them and playing aggressively only when the situation called for it. Reflection upon this made me realize how this spoke to me at an innate level. When interacting, I am rarely the type of person who criticizes someone and makes preemptive judgements - I remain defensive. But, when someone attempts to ridicule me, I turn on my aggression and defend myself with replies of equal wit and intensity. The pressure-bearing aspect that comes with it is the one I love the most. With four runs required and one delivery left in the game, I am the one most of my team members want at the crease. In their words: You're the only who can maintain eagle-eye focus and nerves of steel in such a pressure-inducing situation. I pride myself on my ability to remain calm and think clearly when in a predicament. I may not always win the game, but I believe I give myself a strong chance when I do the basics right, keeping a level-headed mind."
"I am sitting with a few friends, playing cards, and everyone is focused on winning the game. Asma's face begins to glee, and she excitedly puts down the pair she has formed to win the game, but as soon as she does so, she picks up her phone and begins texting - so does everyone else. No celebration, no arguments, nothing. This is when I noticed: The art of conversation is lost. This always happens: When we go to restaurants, we just open Snapchat and take selfies or start browsing our news feed on Facebook. I initiate discussions, but as soon as they end, everyone goes back to this habit of theirs. We are beginning to lose our ability to hold conversations. I have noticed loss in confidence, weakening of relations etc. I, personally, love having proper conversations and going to coffee-shops just to talk. I resent this change."
"The types of people I will meet and the relationships I will build with them. Having lived in Indonesia and studied in an international school, I had the opportunity to meet and befriend people from all over the world. Studying in a community comprised of people from distinct backgrounds and lifestyles developed within me the ability to view things from different perspectives. This is one of the major reasons I want to study at Emory, where I will have the opportunity to interact with all kinds of people. I will further develop more such traits that only bud when you have the exact right environment. Not only that, living in such close-proximity and spending most of the next 4 years with them will help me develop bonds with people that may even last a life-time."
"We are all failures. Sweat was running down my face. It was the last ten minutes of the finals of the under 17 soccer league, and we were winning 3 to 1. I started to relaxed, maybe I overrelaxed, as the next thing I know, we concede. It is all right; 'we were still winning' was the words ringing in my mind. The opposition kicked off, and I was on the ball. In a moment of lapse concentration I give the ball away cheaply. The opposition punishes the team with that single mistake. The game went into extra time, where the momentum picked up by the opposition led them to victory. By no means was this the end of the world but this failure triggered significant changes in my life. First off, my coach started to drop me for critical games. The trust the coaches once had in me was broken. Training sessions become increasingly frustrating as my mistakes are carefully noted while teammates aren't. On a mental level, my confidence was shot. My teammate's faith in me was nonexistent. Seeing the continuing consequences of my action, I reanalyse that single moment again and again in my head. I expected to win because of the current scoreline and because of this I became too confident. At that moment I became overdependent on my teammates. However, in failing, I was humbled and became aware of the importance of concentration and teamwork. A team cannot function if one of it's parts doesn't play a role. Just like a small screw on a vehicle, without it, the increased pressure on its other structures will eventually cause the whole vehicle to collapse. ""When doing something whether big or small, do it right, or don't do it at all"". This was one of the phrases that pop into my mind while reanalyzing the sequence. My mum recognised its importance and tried to installed me with the mentality. Too bad it took failure for me to truly understand this phrase. In saying so, this particular failure was a hard lesson that I must learn in order progress and develop myself. Another big lesson I learned was in regards to trust. ""Trust is hard to earn and easy to lose."" The loss of faith was so swift that it took me by complete surprise. It took failure to teach me a life lesson in being responsible for my actions. In saying so, I recognise now that everything I choose to do regardless of when or where will have consequences whether good or bad. Giving the ball away on the Final's game night led to consequences of loss of coach's faith. I now, therefore, choose carefully to maintain a trust that is so easy to break. In fact, It took failure to awaken me to the reality of failures. Failures should really be the treasure that everyone seeks as, without successful failures to learn from, success would be unachievable. Remember back to your younger years. When failures were congratulated by family members. When trying to take your first step and failing. When trying to speak for the first time. In fact, I argue that we are all failures, but as long as we learn from them, we will become more successful. Like you I am also a failure and it is due to failing that I am now always concerned with my actions. Whether in the case of teamwork or of individual work I am always working to ""do it right, or not do it at all"" because I understand that a drop in concentration can potentially lead to dire consequences such as a loss of trust or lost in another final. I now can say with certainty that my experience of this failure help me grow and is vital to my future success."
"Diabetes, the plague of the 21st century. As the first-world become increasingly convenient, so do the threat of a diabetes epidemic. The capitalist system has provided an environment for the disease to thrive evident in the way fast food industry becoming increasingly more affordable. Some family household has seen a complete reliant on fast food as their daily meal consumptions due to the incredible sale prices. What people don't know does hurt them however as the amount of corners cut by major fast food chain to lower their sale prices lead to lower quality of food, lower nutrient supplied in food as well as an overall increase in fatty content to created the greasy scrumptious taste. This is a recipe for disaster as seen in my own country. 1.7 million Australian suffer type II diabetes and the number grows by the day. My dad is a living example..."
"""You only know that you love them when you let them go."" My dad receives his first warning from the Reaper when he collapses on the floor during work. Doctor diagnosed it as a heart attack (minor), but the warning was enough. My whole family had diabetes all except my siblings and I. Plagued by the genetics God game me, I knew what my goals were. Years of off the book biological study became more than just an interest. It became a passion. How do I cure this disease? My dad became a motivating factor as to why I took a semester of biology at summer school. Every time I find a concept too hard to bear, a flash of a possible future flash through my eyes: another collapse, this time it was a major heart attack. The pain of loss is much greater the pain of study."
"""3,000, 4,050... 10,000 clicks, won!"" We jumped with joy. Ten thousand would never be a simple number to us. It combined with the efforts of all members. ""There is no need to build a division of information. We already have two publicity departments."" The secretary of Student Union said resolutely. ""The Student Union needs a department to follow the information trend since most of students in our school own a smart phone. And we will build the one."" I replied firmly. My words stunned the secretary. Soon I was asked to write a tweet to publicize our school through online platform. If we receive 10,000 clicks in two weeks, the department could be established. I accepted the challenge. However, some of my friends who promised to join my new department dropped out. I could understand that they didn't want to waste time in a nearly impossible task. And I had made the worst plan that even if I was the only one left, I would never give up. To my surprise, seven out of seventeen stayed. I divided them into two groups. The first one was responsible for developing WeChat public platform. The second one was in charge of gathering information and writing tweet. Two days passed, we still couldn't decide which subject to choose from. ""Collecting suggestions from students is the most effective way, which is also a way to prove our aim: serving students."" I suggested. Surprisingly, it just took us five hours to receive 500 piece of advice from students through an online questionnaire survey we lunched in SurveyMonkey. Problem was solved. Then we collected information for the source of the tweet from past tweets, publicity department, photography club and so on. We also took pictures around school to capture the beauty of our campus. I undertook the difficulty part: sorting out the information. I must select useful information from over 300 photos and 50 articles we gathered and then classifying the data. Firstly, I communicated with leaders of each department in the student union to learn more about their function for the introduction part of Student Union. Then, I categorized all of the information we gathered by function. With a clear structure, things became easy. I also invited the school television station to make a video to enrich the content. I stared at the tweet we released on WeChat every day. Each additional click would make me excited. Finally, we received 11,000 clicks in one and half week ahead of the schedule. The secretary agreed with the establishment of the department. However, one problem followed another! Applying for expenditure from school to buy computer for our department was not approved. I knew I must do something, or else our efforts would end up with nothing. Buying accessories to assemble our own desktop was cheaper than buying a new one. As I suggested, we built two computers which we use till now. But I could not feel relieved yet. There were far more things to be done. I negotiated with leaders of other departments to take charge of publicity part, when they organized activities. The information released through our online platform could spread throughout the school in just one day even one hour. Publicizing activities in turn was also a good way to publicize our department. Gradually, our department became school's source of information. Flashing back all the difficulties I have encountered since the department was established, I felt so proud. I will meet many challenges in college study or my career life and I know I will not run away."
"I think one important challenge is the problem that technology could bring to us. Recently, a piece of news about first baby born using a new three-person-fertility technic spreads, in which scientists added a small amount of genetic code from a donor to the baby's parents. It does not only indicate the great progress in medical science, but also evoke ethical argument over it. Technology brings many benefits for our life, but many problems also show up, such as environmental pollution. How to find the balance between technology and human development is the difficulty we faced."
"My ideal campus would be with strong cultural atmosphere where diversities are respected. Majoring in computer science in Emory University could lay a general and solid foundation for my further education. Emory Robotics and Computer Engineering club could continue my interest in computer. Research at Emory College could give me a chance to cooperate with excellent student fellow, peers with common interest and outstanding coaches. The Atlanta area's national prominence in high technology and the Co-ops opportunity could support me apply what I've learned to real life. These practical experiences would help me adapt to career life in advance."
"As I put on the iconic beret and brought out my ultimate crayon collection, I felt wholly prepared. At eight, I wanted to gift my mom a Mona Lisa portrait. Yet, my masterpiece failed to capture that mysterious smile. It featured instead Mike Wazowski's broad grin from The Monster Inc. With art styles so abstract even I couldn't understand, and calligraphy skills rivaling that of doctors', I was never an artistic kid. Art revisited me in its most unexpected form. I found myself wrestling again with design concepts when opening my coffee shop, Teemay. Designing Teemay was particularly challenging given my lack of artistic taste, but I was motivated to provide customers the best experience possible. To create an overarching designing theme that best reflected Teemay's warm and welcoming image, I spent hours wrestling with different color schemes; and navigated around the city under the scorching sun to visit various furniture and decor shops. Reaching out to friends who studied interior design for suggestions, I tried to avoid making such catastrophic mistakes as combining orange contemporary sofas with the Victorian chestnut-colored room. After months of dedicated effort, I finally created an inviting Teemay just as I envisioned. The indoor area, decorated with brick walls, vintage wallpaper and vinyl players, brings a taste of 1920s New York and Victorian era. While the first floor is lively with the gurgling of coffee brewing and occasional conversations between baristas and customers; the second floor was designed to be a more serene and comfortable workplace. Soft instrumental music and sorrel sofas provide both a relaxing place for customers to enjoy their time, and an ideal setting for large group meetings. Like an artisan crafting his work, I poured my heart into every detail to create Teemay's unique charms. I grew to realize that design is crucial for all business aspects. Appealing interior design alone could not make Teemay memorable to customers, as I also needed to creatively think about how to best engage and interact with them. In business terms, this is marketing strategies and employee management. To be able to leave a distinctive impression of Teemay for customers, I started organizing events such as roastery tours, where a roasting artisan and I would demonstrate the artistry of the roasting process, allowing customers to experience different aromas. To make sure that Teemay customers feel warmly welcomed, our staff, who were all coffee-lovers, were always ready to answer any inquisitive questions about coffee. I believe that seeing how Teemay employees showed such passion for coffee and fully engaged themselves in the craft, customers would also develop a better appreciation for coffee. With curious children tiptoeing to look at the roasting process, or a tired regular getting pleasantly surprised by a ""Long day? Hope this helps :)"" note accompanying his drink, Teemay is more than just a coffee shop. It became a place where people could feel at home, and enjoy a hiatus from their hectic lives. Teemay's success is not measured by financial profits, but by the meaningful relationships between customers and staff. This is, to me, the art of business. My artistic talents never developed further than squiggle drawings or stick figures, but Teemay has allowed me to express myself and my creativity through a different medium. From interior design to customer service, I pushed myself to both constantly innovate and be attentive to small details. I found satisfaction in taking that extra step to make Teemay a special place for my customers. The fruits of that effort were rewarding as I also acquired many valuable interpersonal skills. Teemay taught me to be an effective and trustworthy leader for my employees, a compassionate friend for customers from different walks of life, and - most unexpectedly - an unconventional artist. In a sense, I considered Teemay my work of art. It might not be perfect, but it may bring a Mona Lisa smile in others."
"With its perfect balance between nurturing and encouraging independence, Emory College provides the guidance its student need while enabling them to carve their own paths. At Emory, I could get early exposure to the industry, while still having Emory professors scaffolding my learning experience. Such opportunities as case competitions, ASCEND and UBSLC would help me develop a strategic mindset integral to entrepreneurs, and mature into a resourceful self-starter. Meanwhile, the research funding available at Emory would allow me to work on interdisciplinary projects that could positively impact our community. In particular, I wish to delve deeper into unexplored uses of coffee, like creating a natural supplement that reduces risks of Alzheimer's disease or liver cancer, and hopefully develop a beneficial product. With Emory as a safety net, I would have the courage to push through boundaries with confidence, take calculated risks to expand my business, and turn aspirations into reality."
"Flipping through the psychology textbook, I marveled at how far this relatively young science has taken me into understanding social interactions. Meanwhile, my Business course offered fascinating insights into how people behave in response to changes. Humanities were not only intriguing to learn, but also highly pertinent - since I could use such knowledge to make an impact on others' lives. As the owner of Teemay Coffee, I applied psychological principles to managing a stimulating and collaborative workplace for my employees; and a comfortable environment where customers could enjoy a hiatus from their chaotic schedules. Cultural and business studies also make me appreciative of the diversity in cultures, and thus more compassionate and open-minded towards people from different backgrounds. Finding a connection between theoretical facts I learned and a real-life situation was incredibly fulfilling, and especially so if I could apply such facts to creating a positive environment for others."
"I have been stabbed multiple times. Each wound allows me to improve my strength and resolve. The referee sends me back to my starting line, and I get in position: legs bent, feet shoulder width apart, right arm guarding my body, and weapon ready. The timer goes off, and we step forward. I bounce back and forth, buying time to remember my strategy. ""Left. Right. Up... STAB!"" The force of my opponent's blow stuns me, and I wince aloud. I regroup and try to push my opponent off the strip, but he evades my blade, and I take another STAB. As a fencer, I have learned that taking stabs is a part of life. Fortunately, each stab has taught me to strategize, to learn from my failures, and to seek improvement instead of perfection. The first time you take a stab in fencing it throws you back, leaving you stunned and defenseless. You quickly realize that to avoid being stabbed, you must have a solid strategy. As a student, the first stab came during freshman biology. I paid attention in class and took notes, but my attempts were failing me. By the end of the first quarter, I was losing the match and receiving a C in the class. I knew I had to change my strategy. Every day, I went to my teacher after school and asked questions about the content we learned in class. I spent time rereading all my notes, creating study guides, and planning a study schedule. By adjusting my approach to biology, I was able to end the year off with a B. I learned that, before one can hope to win, one must develop a solid strategy. All great fencers have fallen at one point and had to restart from point zero. We have all had a match where we stepped onto the strip and completely failed. At school, this match was against my World History class. It seems like no matter how hard I tried, I could not earn higher than a D in the class, the lowest grade I have ever received in my life. At first, I felt like giving up. But, I asked my teacher if I could review my old work. I quickly realized I was not spending enough time memorizing important people, places, and events, and I was not reading closely enough to include critical details in papers and on tests. Once I improved this, I brought my grade for the year up to a B. With fencing and with World History, taking a close look at your failures is the only path to success. The only way to move forward is to take an honest look at your mistakes and work tirelessly to correct them. ""Lunge. Parry. Retreat."" Every fencer knows these commands by heart, as they are the foundation of success every coach preaches, though many fencers begin with visions of accomplishment that encourage them to employ unorthodox moves and styles. Academically, the New Jersey Law and Education Empowerment Project (NJLEEP) is my coach. The commands NJLEEP gives its students are to spend the four years of high school mastering reading, writing, and oration through programs like Constitutional Law Debates. Years of writing legal briefs and participating in appellate style debates has helped me improve, because I kept working hard, even when I failed to win competitions. Though I have only won one of seven debates, I am proud that I have improved at every debate and grateful that NJLEEP taught me to focus on improvement instead of perfection. Like fencing, life is always ready to lunge at you with full force. Fortunately, fencing has taught me how to plan, learn from my failures, and strive for consistent improvement. I am ready for college, because fencing has given me the confidence to stand my ground and push forward, as a student and as a young woman."
"After being born in Cape Verde and moving to America, I am someone who is not bound to one place. Therefore, I most look forward to studying abroad in South Korea during my college experience. More than a being tourist, studying abroad will give me a new perspective from which I can study and socialize. As a computer science major, visiting Korea, one of the world's most technologically advanced countries, I can see how they have incorporated technology into their day to day lives. As a linguistics minor, I can analyze how language and expression are incorporated into day to day life, rather than just reading about it in a text book. Studying abroad would give my international travel purpose, so rather than just being a tourist, I can learn and live within the culture, to foster my growth and development as a student and citizen of the world."
"Spirited Away is one of my favorite movies, because I find it so meaningful. I first saw the movie when I was 7 years old and watched it again in middle school. Though I was several years older the second time I watched it, I was still amazed by the robust characters and the Japanese folklore it presents. After you are transported into the bathhouse where the story takes place, you are introduced to amazing characters, such as large chicks, lizard people, and river deities. Seeing how the creators were able to so aptly incorporate folklore into the film to expose viewers from other countries to Japanese culture and tradition was exciting. As a creative person who is an artist, being invited into the movie's diverse and beautiful world gave me the inspiration to grow my talent, so that I can create something that will inspire others."
"Eyes locked on target. Shoulders tense, knees bent, I lean forward. With weight on the tip of my toes, I extend for a final lunge. Arms outstretched, I launch myself forward. As my heel hits the ground, my blade grazes my opponent and their sword strikes my ribs. A lone beep breaks through, and the world rushes back into focus. I fence. Why do I fence? I've asked myself this many times, but I fence because I like the challenges it presents. There's a thrill to analyzing the situation and outmaneuvering your opponent. Thinking on your feet, predicting their next move, intaking each bit of information with every action and reaction; this is fencing. To me, fencing is like problem solving, where each opponent is a unique puzzle because no two people fence the same. Every person I face is a new challenge, and I have to figure out how to win in each scenario; this is what I love about fencing. However, I tried to solve different puzzles using the same method. And it worked for the most part, until it didn't. I discovered that I had hit a plateau. Although you get to stab people with pointy sticks, fencing is still a complex sport requiring athleticism, technique, and strategy at every step. But you also need to be able to quickly adjust yourself and adapt in different situations accordingly. My fencing style has always been defensive and reactionary because it worked for me. Therefore, that's how I fenced in every match. I seldom attacked; I was predictable. This is how I was outside of fencing as well. I had the control, athleticism, and strategy, but I needed to step out of my comfort zone and change my fencing style if I wanted to start winning again. I began by setting small goals for myself daily. In the beginning, my goal was to attack at least once per opponent. It felt forced at first but I persevered. As it began feeling more natural, I started initiating more attacks and experimenting with different styles. It even got to the point where I would challenge myself to only use attacks. But my progress was not just limited to fencing. I felt more comfortable presenting myself in general and I began challenging myself to speak out more. I became increasingly confident inside and outside the classroom, and specifically in fencing. However, my growing confidence didn't make me an aggressive fencer; rather, it made me more decisive of my actions and more willing to take control as opposed to just reacting to my opponent's actions. As I strived to improve my fencing skills, I found myself leading by example. I began actively helping my teammates by working one-on-one with a different person every practice, and it was often the highlight of my day. By getting to know each individual as a fencer, I am better able to help them utilize their strengths and defend against their weaknesses. Now that I understand myself as a fencer, I felt more suited to lead my teammates as captain. Though it seems like my journey has come to an end, that's not the case; rather, my goal has changed. Now it is to not only improve myself, but to help others begin their journey and to act as their guide. Because fencing is more of an individual sport than a team sport, the effective way to learn is by practicing with different types of fencers. With a team, you get the benefit of learning from each other, but in the end, your victory is dependent upon your performance alone. Thanks to fencing, I have developed a love for problem solving and I find myself actively seeking to improve myself at whatever I set my mind to. Although I wish I had challenged myself sooner, I can look at myself today and see how much progress I've made."
"Walking by an open classroom; students sit in a circle discussing intersexuality and the idea of gender. Swinging by the library; students study in groups, sharing notes on irregular verbs and the scansion rules for their Latin class. In the common space, students take breaks from work to debate everything from the electoral college to the ""best"" condiment (mustard). This describes my ideal college campus. My ideal college campus is centered around collaboration, a community that promotes discussion about whatever, whenever and wherever. It does not shy away from complex and difficult topics and the dialogue can even continue outside the classroom. In this kind of setting, we feel comfortable being challenged about our thinking. Though we may not always be able to arrive at a conclusion, together, we will continue to grapple, to create, and to think about diverse issues from animal rights to gender identity."
"There are an infinite amount of disciplines the world has to offer to us college students, and we dub those as ""majors"". While the individual study of neuroscience, engineering, or linguistics interests me, what inspires me the most are the connections between multiple disciplines. Interdisciplinary studies. For example, if you study engineering and neuroscience, you can study the efficiency in the brain's neuropathways and how to improve it in a patient with head trauma. If you study the brain and languages, you can better understand that relationship which in turn can explain language disorders and gender differences in the brain. Though some of these connections may seem arbitrary and convoluted, that only motivates me even more to understand that relationship and its potential impact. That challenge in itself is what motivates me to learn."
"It felt as if a bullet was fired into the bones on the outside of my right foot. The smallest amount of weight on my foot caused excruciating pain. Just skimming the bottom of my foot on the floor made me cringe. There was no way I could do ballet the next day and the days to come. Having experienced sprained ankles before, there was no doubt in my mind that, this time, my foot was broken. My first year in The Washington School of Ballet's Professional Training Program was the year I broke my foot. I had always striven to be a part of this program, but my teachers said I probably would never make it as a dancer because of my lack of flexibility and knobby knees. That encouraged me to work harder. At age eleven, I stretched and did Pilates and other exercises religiously to prove the teachers wrong. My acceptance into the program five years later was a shock to me, and I thought, ""Wow, my hard work is paying off."" The worst part of it all: This injury did not even happen dancing. In April 2015, after a hard day of ballet, my right foot fell asleep unknowingly while I sat at my friend's dance competition. I stood quickly, anxious to congratulate my friend. When I put my full weight on my entirely limp foot, I heard it pop. Instead of crying, I thought, ""You have got to be kidding me!"" An injury was the last thing I needed with our spring performance coming up, as well as attending Boston Ballet's five-week summer program. The x-ray showed a fifth metatarsal fracture; my doctor said I would be in a boot for six weeks. Heartbroken, I worried that everything I had done the last five years would be thrown away. No way would I be able to come back to the level I was at prior to this accident. Despite the depressing imprisonment in my boot, I still went to class. When my teacher asked if I wanted to relax, I said no. I stretched all the time and did the core exercises that I could. I worried about falling behind in my ballet training. I was so disappointed that I couldn't perform in our spring performance, or go to the five-week summer program in Boston. While everyone was improving and having new experiences, I was restricted. Those six weeks were dreadful, but I was determined to pursue my goals, broken foot or not. By the time I got back in shape and returned fully to ballet, I surprisingly felt stronger. I could balance longer and throw my leg higher. The many years of hard work were not a wasted effort. More importantly, I learned that things in life can completely change without warning and that you have to make the most of every situation. Now, I do everything at 100 percent. Even if it is something I would rather not do. This setback brought me forward. I stayed positive and did the absolute best I could. This experience has showed me that determination can override a setback or a negative experience. I am currently taking a gap year because I was offered a position with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. Part of me feels like I could fall behind academically because most people go to college immediately after high school. However, having come back from my broken foot, I realize I won't fall behind. This opportunity is exactly what I have trained for and all that I have worked for in rehabilitating my foot. This unique dancing experience will propel me forward when I attend college next year. That injury made me a stronger dancer and a more mature, confident person - giving 100 percent in everything every day. This path will truly put my regained strength to the test."
"Technology is an important challenge facing our generation in the next 50 years. While advances in technology will always be important, they are also starting to hurt our generation. Teenagers, children, and even some adults, would rather sit and play games on their phone, watch the latest television show, or play each other on video games rather than go outside or talk with one another. It is hard for me to convince my own brother to play a board game with me even though there is nothing meaningful that we are doing. People in lines or elevators or other public places don't speak or make eye contact anymore, and instead seem to use their phones as a means to avoid interaction. The art of conversation is dying and it is our generation's job to make sure that human, face-to-face interaction doesn't stop, particularly as technology becomes more and more advanced."
"Armageddon is my all-time favorite movie. Asteroids hurl towards Earth and unqualified people are sent to space, fulfilling my three favorite aspects of a film: action, suspense, and comedy. Although I have watched this movie countless times, I am on a rollercoaster the whole time. One minute you are happy, then sad; afraid, then excited. The endless action keeps you on the edge of your seat. When you think all is well, the unthinkable happens. One person has to stay in space, sacrificing themselves for the rest of humanity. You go from excitement to complete devastation when Bruce Willis' character stays behind. His daughter will never see him again and it is heartbreaking. You think movies aren't supposed to end that way; but then you are reminded to never take what you have for granted, and truly appreciate the world and the endless opportunities around us. Go see it!"
"Four dimensions, three fears, two mismatched strips of paper, and one apprehensive presenter: my first high school project was a recipe for disaster. I stood before my freshman math class, sweating profusely, wincing at the computer's lag as I connected it to the board and prepared to give my 45-minute presentation. My teacher's distress was evident. She was clearly having second thoughts about allotting me a full class period to teach when the assignment had called for 5-minute sessions. Still, she agreed it was justified - with a topic as abstract as ""Klein Bottles,"" I needed every second. Growing up, I'd always had a fascination with four-dimensional space. I have fond memories of 8-year-old me lying on my living room's tattered, flower-print carpet, oblivious to the static electricity collecting in the back of my sweater, swaying from side to side, contorting my limbs to try and find the ever elusive fourth dimension I had watched documentaries about on National Geographic. I never got very far. But that isn't to say it was a useless exercise - contortion, after all, is a skill that will serve any young Muslim-American girl like me well. It's also not insignificant that I began this exercise at age eight, the year I first started attending a public school. For the first few years of my education, my parents enrolled me at an Islamic private school. They wanted me to get a good foundation, to understand where I came from. Come third grade, however, I was transferred to a public school. It was then that I was first exposed to a world apart from my own, and it was then that my classmates were first exposed to me. I certainly was not the only Muslim person at my school, but I was the only one who wore a headscarf, so for better or for worse, I was the token. A Klein bottle is a four-dimensional figure. It has a wide base that tapers into a narrow neck, curves downward, passes through the bottle's wall at a point called the nexus, and widens inside to form the bottom. With the exception of the nexus, where the surface must go through itself without making a hole, (a singularity that can only be accomplished in the fourth dimension,) every patch on its surface is two-dimensional. Thus, it is an easy shape to model in our world, but impossible to recreate. We must simplify it to see it. My classmates understood only the broad strokes of who I was. Most saw little past the flat character suggested by my clothing. So I shouldered the weight of others' expectations; I tried to represent all Muslims because I was ""the Muslim girl,"" or, at least, because that was the only patch of me people saw. I bore the burden of contorting to match the flat shape suggested by my most obvious trait. Since then, I have come to learn that I love it. I pride myself on being an outspoken member of an underrepresented group. I gladly discuss my culture and heritage with anyone who will listen. However, equally important to me has been the cultivating of myself in other respects. I have been a member of the debate team to hone my skill for public speaking. I have taken music classes and acted in the play to satisfy my artistic need. I have spent weekends with my family to strengthen our bonds. And I have taken up knitting to keep my hands busy during the summer months. Over time, I have come to appreciate more and more the one-sidedness of the humble Klein bottle. Its inside and outside are one and the same. It is elegantly self-containing, a sovereign figure with no volume, no restraints. It isn't fully understood, but it is accepted. And while my freshman project passed without major incident, my biggest project, myself, is yet to be complete."
"My favorite work is the short poem ""Written By Himself,"" by Gregory Pardlo. The piece describes the circumstances of the speaker's birth, utilizing beautiful imagery. But I was struck with the subtlety of its message. It was only upon my third reading that I realized its deep seated connection to the African American experience. In fact, the very title hearkens to that of Frederick Douglass' autobiography. The phrase ""Written By Himself"" does not imply the ownership of one's story, but rather the reluctant acceptance of one's identity bestowed by birth, an idea that is both specific to the African American narrative, and a universal commonality of the human condition. Pardlo takes his unique experience as a black man in the 21st century and frames it in a way that invites his readers to insert their own background, giving his writings a fluidity that drew me to the work."
"My ideal college is one that gives its students the resources and support they need to pursue their own passions and intellectual queries. I have interests in a wide range of fields, from epidemiology to music theory, so I desire an educational atmosphere that encourages diverse passions, as well as one that has the outstanding faculty and the research capacity to support me in my academic endeavors. I would like to go to a school where a well-rounded, all-encompassing education is not only available, but encouraged. The openness of the curriculum would give me the freedom I seek to explore multiple interests, while the specialized attention and availability of unique opportunities would allow me to delve deeper into my main focus. I would take advantage of this environment in order to become more cultivated as an individual and more prepared for the next steps in my academic career."
"""Dad, what kind of person am I?"" my father jumped out of his seat as if he already knew I was going to ask him that question. ""I'd say that you are an adventurous yet focused young lady."" He did not explain what he meant and left me with confusion. Adventurous yet focused. These two words are such a strange combination, and I wondered how I could be both. Then, I remembered how I went to live with my aunt in Chile without my parents at the age of ten. I was not scared to go to my new international school when I did not even speak Spanish or English. I was more excited than nervous to meet new friends and live in a different country. In South Korea, where I am from, a highly competitive nature is deeply rooted in its education system. I was ready to escape the pressure and jump into freedom. I did not do well in school at the beginning because of my language barrier in Chile. However, I was not worried about my grades. I was simply pleased to try new foods, travel to nearby cities, and make friends of different ethnicities. I knew I might never come back, so I focused on making good memories, experiencing the unique culture, and expanding my horizons. After spending a year there, I learned a valuable lesson that ultimately helped me adapt to my new life in the United States: friendships could exist beyond language barriers, religious beliefs, and race. Two years after I came back to Korea from Chile, my parents had decided to move to the United States. Although moving to Louisiana was not my choice, I was ready to take on a new challenge. On the first day of school, I was not nervous at all since I already had been to a school with the American education system. However, things did not turn out as I expected. Because I did not speak perfect English, the kids did not bother to talk to me much. My confidence in English dropped drastically, and I became very insecure about the way I spoke. I practiced by listening to audiobooks and mimicking the speaker. My pronunciation improved, and I learned to be confident every morning despite the challenges. Eventually, I became the talkative and positive girl I once was. When high school started, I wanted to try new things. Therefore, I decided to join the basketball team. I was the worst player on the court, but I was determined to change that. I earned a spot on the Junior Varsity team later that season as a freshman. I stayed on the team for two years until our school band director asked me to play the piano for the school jazz ensemble. I believed I had overcome the challenge of becoming an athlete, so I accepted the new challenge. I was only classically trained and did not know a thing about jazz. With practice, however, I was successful in extending my improvisational solos. I am interested in various subjects, and I am not afraid to try them. Once I start a new challenge, I do not stop until I master it. I am proud of all the achievements I have accomplished through these activities, but I am even more proud of all the meaningful relationships I have built through them. I remember the sweat and tears I shared with my teammates, and I remember the joy and excitement I shared with my band members. I realized once again that friendships could exist beyond differences and these friendships would last a lifetime. I have travelled over 70,000 miles in the past eighteen years of my life. My experiences of living in various countries helped define who I am today: an adventurous yet focused individual. I have learned to challenge myself, work for what I want, and build meaningful relationships."
"Age-appropriate sex education is necessary for a healthy understanding of sexuality and reproduction. However, current education programs frequently fail to provide students with a deep understanding of the responsibilities involved in being sexually active. These programs usually last less than a few days, which leads students to underestimate the seriousness of the topic. Implementing an effective sexual education is essential to reducing unwanted teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Sex can be a sensitive topic, especially with people who do not share the same values and beliefs. However, effective sex education programs are absolutely needed to help students make healthy decisions based on accurate information. My generation often views such topics as entertainment rather than responsibility. Educating our generation to have a mature attitude towards the topic is essential to maintaining our society's health."
"I am looking for a university where I will not only be challenged academically, but will also grow spiritually. A university should provide its students with the best possible resources and environment where students can discover and focus on what they are truly interested in. Simultaneously, it should be a place where students encounter different ideas and cultures and learn to be tolerant of these differences. Emory is well known for its outstanding pre-medicine program. As a student who wants to study medicine and become a doctor, I will be well prepared to attend medical school with the resources Emory provides. By interacting with other students from various parts of the world, I will be able to leave my comfort zones to experience unfamiliar people and activities, which will ultimately help me find what I truly love and enjoy."
"Every day for three weeks since October 17th, I processed files from the Colorado Secretary of State with the name of every individual that voted early. On November 8th, I nervously observed Colorado's ballot count increase as we processed the vote records every ten and thirty minutes after the hour. That morning on my one-year anniversary of becoming a beneficiary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), I sang along to ""Fight Song"" by Rachel Platten, unaware that hours later my future would be threatened with a President-elect who campaigned to revert progress on comprehensive immigration reform. President Obama's executive action providing relief from deportation to young undocumented immigrants embodied my hope for comprehensive immigration reform. Witnessing the president unveil Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Permanent Residents (DAPA), and the expansion of DACA at Del Sol High School in November 2014 sparked my passion for activism. After watching him speak, I felt compelled to ensure his successor would uphold and deepen these programs. In the months following, I anxiously waited for my opportunity to participate. On April 26th, 2015, I met with a Regional Organizing Director for Hillary Clinton's campaign in Nevada to discuss how I could contribute to Clinton's success. Every week, I bussed over an hour to make a hundred calls in a coffee shop in south Las Vegas. After graduation in June, I committed to an internship with the field department where I learned from an incredible team of organizers how to register voters, organize events, and educate the public about the Nevada caucuses in February. After a four-month wait and through the guidance of my local representative, Congresswoman Titus, I received DACA, thus permitting me employment as a full-time field organizer. In May, with the general election beginning, I transferred to Denver, leaving the comfort of home in Las Vegas. The Coordinated Campaign hired me as a Deputy Data Director in Colorado, uniting the individual campaigns for Hillary Clinton, Senator Michael Bennet, and several congressional candidates. The opportunities seemed to stream boundlessly with obstacles disappearing one by one after I attained DACA. For the first time in years, my family's daily fears of eviction, debt, sickness, and the lack of clarity in our future lifted. Through my income, I began to provide the resources and finances my four siblings and mother needed. At nearly midnight on Election Day, Wolf Blitzer of CNN announced Wisconsin projected for Donald Trump. At that moment, memories of the hundreds, maybe even thousands, of individuals I met on the campaign trail overwhelmed me. President Obama sparked my activism, but the everyday interactions I had with my community fueled my drive and resilience over the year and a half I spent campaigning for Hillary Clinton. On private Facebook groups for Deferred Action, individuals expressed their anxiety and sadness, ensuing a necessary surge of posts with the suicide hotline number. With knowledge of my immigrant status, I learned quickly as a child that the boogey-man under the bed was imaginary, but Immigrations and Customs Enforcement was real. When I instigated conversations about immigration, my father would inform me, ""Bahala ka sa buhay mo,"" meaning ""do what you want with your life"" in Tagalog, to cease discussion. Silence and fear ran our lives, but I desired a future that wasn't walking down a tightrope every day. DACA became the first stepping stone in my future path. In the past two years, I learned how and why I fight for my community, strengthening my voice through personal stories of those around me. Despite the threat that looms over DACA and the end to the 2016 elections, I don't intend to stop fighting."
"The ill-conceived notion that college is Greek Life, social gatherings, and an abundance of leisure time spawned from Hollywood films, such as ""Old School"", ""Animal House"", and ""American Pie"". The social scene of university life appeals to young adults as an opportunity to envision a new-found individuality. Despite some truths in the movies, the accessibility of vast intellectual exploration and boundless resources for advancements inclines me greater as an incoming student. University provides a platform of students with desire for discovery of oneself and life; I aspire to utilize the educational opportunities provided and diverse perspectives of my peers to devise new innovations to contribute to technology. My vision to one day apply my experience from undergraduate research, management of organizations, and knowledge in computer science to discover a product idea, invent, and establish my own startup."
"As a child, I indulged in the pages of the encyclopedia books stacked at the corner of my bedroom. The snippets of information incited my curiosity of the world's innovations. Now, I frequent online coding courses to ensure development of my programming capabilities and arrange small research projects to satisfy my curiosity. In elementary school, I often questioned the production of innovative ideas and process of physical development. Additionally, I pondered over why flying cars weren't created yet, despite ""The Jetsons"" popularizing the concept. I realized the vast complexities of inventions and advancements when I grew up, hence reasons for interdisciplinary research and higher education. I learned that I could only assist in progress of modernization when I attained the knowledge required; therefore, I persist to pursue intellectual growth."
"My fingers gently grasp the glass slides as I circle the cells with a pen to mark their location. I pipette the purple dye onto the spots. ""BEEP!"" The timer goes off. Pink and purple splotches spread across the tissues as I tip the stains off. The faint smell of ethanol tingles my nose as I dip the slides into the glass cups. As if by magic, little pink and purple dots appear. I finally figured out how to stain scaffolds. If a tiny success can create such excitement, I cannot wait to see what else research holds for me. As a child, I often visited science museums; I would test earthquake simulators, touch the skin of stingrays, and play with magnetic sand. However, my desire for interactive experiences grew, and I wanted to experience the excitement others felt through their participation in internships; I knew that working in a lab would allow me to dive deeper into my passion. Numerous summer programs offered research positions, but my age created an initial barrier. Nevertheless, I did not take no for an answer. At the end of tenth grade, I reached out to a professor at UC Davis I had previously met. Dr. Leach - a leading figure in biomedical engineering - had fascinating research, and he agreed to take me on as the first high school student in his lab. On my first day, Dr. Leach introduced me to Kaitlin, my research mentor. She wore thick rimmed glasses, tied her blond hair in a ponytail, and greeted me cheerfully. After sorting through the organized chaos on her desk, she explained our goal was to determine if spheroids of cells possessed a hypoxic core by using a probe to measure oxygen concentration. I was tasked to devise a stand to hold the oxygen measurement probe and the spheroids steady. With no prior research experience, frankly, I was quite nervous. However, I successfully designed a mold using CAD-software, producing a device that could hold spheroids less than one millimeter wide. Ultimately, the probe wasn't the optimal tool to measure oxygen concentration, but Kaitlin was impressed by my work and encouraged me to continue my internship in the fall. Initially, I believed research was an individual task; I was quickly proven wrong in the Leach Lab. Even though Jenna and Kaitlin had different areas of expertise, they were supportive of each other's research. I read papers and protocols in order to familiarize myself with the lab's work, but I was not without the help of my colleagues. I never feared failing because I knew I had a strong support system from members of the lab. Kaitlin became more than just a mentor; she became my friend. In between experiments, we'd grab coffee and chat about life, and when she thanked me during her final presentation, I knew I had become an integral part of the team. As my time in the lab has progressed, I've become so proficient in certain lab techniques that everyone in the lab now relies on me to cryosection and stain their samples. Each new assay is exciting, and the lab trusts me to perform tasks independently. There hasn't been a day where I haven't learned something new. When I started my internship, I couldn't imagine working with human cells, but now, I have my own project studying the effects of gold nanoparticles on osteogenesis. Prior to my internship, I was certain I wanted to be a doctor, but now that I've seen how I can create the technologies that doctors will use, I realize that research may hold a more innovative future for me. I could produce a real bone transplant for my grandmother's broken hip, as opposed to the metal screws used now. There are constantly problems to solve and questions to answer, and I can't wait to tackle them."
"Throughout history, men have been given priority over women with access to higher paying jobs, and have held the upper hand in many social standards. Boys tease each other, saying, ""You throw like a girl."" Why do we look down upon girls, rather than empowering the women of our society? It is important that we encourage girls, particularly in STEM, to pursue their passions. Millions of girls' abilities are doubted - their dreams cast aside because people tell them what they cannot do. This discouraging reality exists, but if my Emory peers and I can become role models, we will pull more girls into STEM, closing the gender gap in this field. There have been numerous successful female scientists and researchers, and we need to keep this momentum going. Gender should not be an obstacle to success, and I am definitely not going to let it be one for me."
"Why do plants grow towards light? How can flour, water, and yeast turn into fluffy bread? How can something be both a liquid and a solid? These are just a few of the questions I asked as a child, always looking at the world as a series of science experiments. My curiosity has only grown, from playing with waterproof sand to researching how gold nanoparticles affect the osteogenic potential of stem cells. I constantly ask the ""why"" questions, trying to learn how the world works, as opposed to blindly accepting numbers and facts. My thirst for knowledge drives me to perform my best academically. I don't just scratch the surface - I strive to delve deeper into topics to make connections to modern day scenarios. At Emory, I know I will receive an education that strives to answer all of my questions and encourage me to ask even more."
"I have a unique way of gaining happiness; I gain happiness by giving it out. My school participates in the Kiva project, an online microloan program, where people can lend money to the poor all over the world. A true model of generosity, Kiva charges no interest, and once a loan is paid back, the money is loaned to someone else in the program. I had been contributing to my school's Kiva chapter since tenth grade and was proud to support the goals and dreams of people across the globe. However, besides volunteering at some charity sales and maintaining my online balance with Kiva, I felt like I wanted to do something bigger to help create change. Near the end of eleventh grade, I saw an eating contest on the television. While celebrity participants gulped down bowls of food and the crowd cheered noisily, I had a sudden inspiration: Why not hold an eating contest for charity? Thrilled about this idea, I told our project leader right away. Though he wasn't immediately convinced that it would work, I was determined to do something unique for Kiva, so I spent some time developing a proposal and a presentation. When I presented to my Kiva group one week later, everyone loved it (even the director!): we would have a fruit-eating contest, just in time for the start of summer. I immediately got to work on implementing the proposal. The first step: contacting local produce markets to find fruit donations, as well as volunteers who could help run our contest. Meanwhile, I created schedules for the volunteers and ran several different promotions at school so that my fellow students would hear the news. Our Kiva project advisor even agreed to stand in front of the school wearing a hat made of watermelon rinds! This comedic touch, in particular, was a huge success. People wanted to know more about the watermelons (What's more refreshing in the summer than watermelons?!) and get involved. Soon, my social media account was flooded with a dizzying number of notifications about people signing up. On the big day, as the sun rose over the school's athletic field and heated up the relay track, squiggly steam distorting the horizon, contestants got ready for their refreshing feast. All in all, there were about thirty teams prepared to eat for Kiva; the winner would be the team who finished its food fastest. Supervising the contest, I was delighted to hear so many people cheering for their friends or giggling about how silly everyone looked while shoveling so much fruit into their mouths - pulp and juice making a huge mess. I was also thrilled to see how many people posted pictures from our fundraiser online. Though I'd donated to Kiva before and found that very fulfilling, I felt an even deeper joy in my heart this time: rather than just passively donating money, now I had found a way to raise awareness for a cause so close to my heart. When I did the calculations from our fundraiser, I was ecstatic; the money we had raised was enough to fund donations for three different families' loans on Kiva - plus an additional 70 RMB! We used the surplus to ""give back"" to our contest participants and attendees on the spot, buying cold drinks for everyone in the simmering Shanghai heat. My family always said I was a warm-hearted person, yet I never saw my thoughtfulness as ""special;"" I simply do what feels ""right"" to do, and what feels most right to me is spreading happiness. Seeing people smiling, or even just imagining how happy they will be when they receive my support, I derive a real sense of pleasure. I believe that we can all make a difference in the world, and what makes the biggest difference sometimes is simply offering acts of kindness, starting from right where we are."
"I just watched Avatar for the twenty-seventh time - no doubt, my favorite science fiction movie. Though Avatar is fictitious, even fiction can convey important messages for life. Seven years ago, sitting in the theater when it first came out, I was totally enchanted by the beauty on planet Pandora: the electrical interconnection of the glowing plants, the mental bonds between animals and their riders, and the sacred Tree as the birthplace of their society. The more I watched Avatar, though, I began to see it as a warning bell regarding society's future development. Will we one day become like the invaders in the movie, despoiling resources from an innocent planet? Or have we already done so? Science is invaluable, yet scientists cannot stop their findings from being misused. It is our responsibility to educate ourselves and others so that we can prevent such misuse and violence."
"One gloomy November afternoon, my mother called to ask me to come home early. Anemic, she felt dizzy, and my father was away. My brother had already been diagnosed with pneumonia the previous week. Caring for them through the night, I cried to think of losing my loved ones. Fortunately, the next day, we went to the hospital, where the doctor consoled me and changed their prescriptions. Within days, when we returned, my brother and mother were much healthier and brighter. I will never forget my adoration and gratitude for that doctor when they recovered. So grateful that I almost kneeled down in thanks, I looked at her like a savior. I have always loved helping others, but since then, I realize I, too, want to help by healing, bringing life-saving relief. Yet only education can make that possible. This is why I learn: I learn to someday save lives."
"On an hour and forty-five minute bus ride from school, I shift my attention from the book I'm reading to notice several observations. I notice the sickly smell of marijuana has surprisingly decreased and that the bus driver has missed numerous stops. Returning my attention to my reading, I take a needed nap, and begin my AP physics homework. The most important luxury that I enjoy on my bus ride is that I am able to think and have a moment of quiet and serenity. I am able to reflect about where I am and what my passions are. I am proud that I can fervently determine the differences among infinite DC comic universes and also discuss recent podcasts of TED radio hour on education or listen to Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. The bus reminds me of how blessed I am; I know people wouldn't consider a bus ride a blessing but please understand. Those moments of quiet and serenity are all I get for the day. After that, I deal with parents with exceedingly high expectations that I somehow have to reach. Along with brothers who have even set the bar higher than that. At the end of the day I feel that I am overwhelmed and lost a sense of identity which no one can help me find. Being a first generation Nigerian-American, I am inundated with culture and tradition. This type of environment conditioned me to feel as if I should achieve whatever my brothers accomplished. I have been following the same path as my brothers forever; from piano recitals to 4.0s, I am stuck on this path that has no exit and I have been engaged in the same activities they have. I hated that I was born into a family that the people whom I loved the most are the ones who are making loving and discovering myself impossible. My individuality was impossible for me to obtain, besides gaining the identity of being considered an awkward light-skinned child. I felt so alienated but, strangely enough the bus was able to give me a sense of salvation when I entered my high school, Regis Jesuit. Taking the bus throughout all my years of high school gave me this strange love/hate relationship with the bus. I loved that I was able to meet different people from different parts of Denver and Aurora and listen to different conversations. From high school events, Japanese anime shows, and the current state of the election, these conversations gave me a worldly perspective. I initially hated the bus because each time it smelled worse than the day before and it was an hour and forty-five minutes. Going to school and reeking of something unpleasant was not helpful when I went to my physics class. Since I took public transportation, I thought it made me look mediocre compared to other students and I felt that I was not able to have the same experience as others. Although I had to work twice as hard for my education, I was able to receive a different perspective on my learning. I took pride in my work ethic and it made me understand that I should never be little myself because of my social status. One thing that I truly love about myself is that I have high aspirations and I hold myself up to a high standard. As I progress to the next phase of my life I know that the identity of Chidera Agwu is still in formation. However, there is one thing that I am certain about; I have made a name for myself and I am slowly learning more about who I am and who I will become."
"I want my college experience to be a time of exposure. Atlanta is urban city filled with culture and different new experiences that I am eager to try out. I want to experience failure and struggle to gain an effective work ethic. I am excited to learn and know I will need to embrace failure, something that I can see myself doing at Emory. I am also looking forward to working with some of the professors that will push my limits and allow me to learn new concepts. I want to work with Prof. Donna L. Maney who specializes in studying human behavior along with Prof. Gary J. Bassell who focuses on the cellular biology of the brain. With these two professors, I feel that I will attain the true academic experience of neurobiology/psychology and incorporate their knowledge into my own applications."
"D.C Legends of Tomorrow is a television program that runs on the CW network. The show tells the story of several D.C characters like the Atom and Firerstorm and how together with a team of heroes work together to protect the time line of the universe. I have always been a huge fan of D.C comics and superheroes since I was a child and it's a real pleasure to see them on an actual program. Also this series focuses on time travel; it combines theoretical science along with real history. I am huge science and history nerd, so when I can call out some of the facts of the show and be able to interact with it, it makes the experience all the more real to me."
"I have immersed myself in the world of music for such a long time that tracing the beginning of my journey is difficult. My parents would recount how I would, as a toddler, grab various utensils with which I would bang on pots and pans. While my rhythmic experimentation might not seem grandeur, I now understand it to be proof of my innate fascination with rhythm, and furthermore, the beginning of what I consider to be my life's purpose: music. I cannot say the early years of my life were enjoyable. Along with being on the autistic spectrum and suffering from both depression and a severe anxiety disorder, I was alienated by my peers, as I was the victim of extensive bullying. I was lonely and scared, but refused to cease searching for something positive into which I could channel my energy. Around this time, my father gave me an iPod which contained Green Day's American Idiot and Nirvana's discography. I was captivated by how the bands expressed emotions with their instruments alone, and their music became my solace. While in class, I'd tap pencils on my desk, teaching myself, by ear, the drum patterns of the songs to which I'd listen. After a visit to the principal's office for 'being disruptive' with my pencil-drumming, my dad saw a potential for talent in my persistence and signed me up for weekly drum lessons. After a year, I began attending the School of Rock and performed among other musicians, giving me a productive way to release the negativity I repressed. The head of the school, Carl Restivo, had much faith in my abilities, deciding to introduce me to members of bands such as Jane's Addiction, Rage Against the Machine, and Guns N' Roses, the members of which I occasionally collaborated with. Around eleven, I taught myself guitar and bass and began composing songs. I put together a band known as Ash Panda, and we performed at events for LA Weekly, Whiskey A Go Go, and The Roxy. However, I realized that while rock music helped me heal from the traumatic experiences I endured, I yearned for a more substantial career, unable to envision myself a performing musician forever. We disbanded years later and I found my life's calling shortly after. In eighth grade, I was introduced to trap, a subgenre of rap music primarily from the south. It bolstered edginess I had yet to hear in rock, and the instrumentals were characterized by aggressive drums. Needless to say, I fell in love, invigorated with the same passion I had once experienced. I began producing trap under the moniker Ghostrage when I entered high school and studied music theory along with teaching myself to use various digital audio workshops. During my sophomore year, I left the music academy at my school to focus on my music production and built daily routine: I would make four beats, and send the beats to rap artists, along with building my fan base utilizing various social media applications. I also started selling my beats online. I made a hundred dollars here and there, but nothing substantial. After two years of honing, I landed my first production placement on Chicago rapper Johnny May Cash's True Story album weeks before entering my senior year. By the second semester of senior year, my beat store was flourishing and I was making thousands of dollars. My production credit list expanded immensely as I gained placements with rap moguls Young Scooter, Xavier Wulf, and Dae Dae, among numerous others. I also worked with platinum artist Fetty Wap on his song ""Victor Cruz,"" which remains my most notable song with over five hundred thousand SoundCloud plays. I was even offered to sign to Fetty Wap's label as one of his personal producers upon the record's release. I harbor great ambition and plan on pursuing my dreams with persistence for years to come."
"Despite technology's inherently beneficial nature, younger people have become overly dependent on it. Some adolescents rely solely on Uber for transportation, shirking the responsibility of acquiring a driving license, and denying themselves the independence gained when one saves up to purchase an automobile. Social media is replacing face-to-face communication and consequently devaluing authentic social interaction. Families bond over Pokemon GO, but what genuine interaction are children having with their parents if a screen is the sole consumer of their attention? This is not to say technology is evil-it has undoubtedly proved itself a beacon of progression-however, using it in moderation is a concept with which my generation struggles and detachment from mankind is a problem with consequences we'll be forced to confront soon."
"I have met countless characters during my involvement in the music industry, and I have observed a trend with the individuals who work in the genre of rap music; the trend being a lack of sophistication due to one's renouncement of formal education. While I was fortunate enough to have been raised in an environment in which learning was held to a high regard, the majority of the people with whom I collaborate were raised in poverty-stricken areas infested with drug use and gang violence. Unfortunately, education didn't offer as many benefits as did pursuing a life of criminal activity. Although I cannot relate to their struggles, witnessing their disregard for education and the debilitating effects it has on their reasoning skills, decision-making, and maturity has inspired me to continue learning and seize every opportunity available to broaden my intellect and not take these opportunities for granted."
"With the tens of thousands of applicants applying to a particular school each semester, it can be extremely difficult to pick out the best and brightest candidates, those who stand out among the rest. Since a given student's grades, activities, and biographical information can only explain so much, I feel it is necessary for me to convey a more holistic understanding of who I am. The first thing most people will come to learn about me is that I am a geek. While some readers may assume this term carries a negative connotation, in reality it is a badge I wear with pride. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated with computing. When ""the boys"" were dreaming of muscle cars, when kids were fixated on the next hottest toy, I was bidding for the latest operating system online. More than a hobby, my interest in computers is a passion-one that is driving me towards a career in cybersecurity or software development. As my grandparents have always said, ""when you love what you do for a living, you never work a day in your life."" Another distinguishing characteristic of mine is my insatiable hunger for knowledge. For most of my peers, school was a chore, but for me, the opportunity to learn something new each day has always been a source of excitement. I'd always be skipping ahead a few pages in our textbooks, ready and willing to answer any question my teacher may ask. This often drew the ire of my fellow classmates, but guided by passion and infinite curiosity, I didn't care. This may be what most excites me about college: the opportunity I will have to satisfy my lust for knowledge among others who actually share my motivation. On a related note, I consider myself unique in the sense that I strive to maintain an independent mind. My grandparents will attest that I am always willing to ""question"" everything. I am never content with hearing a statement I believe to be suspect, and occasionally to my detriment, I will not fall in line when forced to accept it. Much of the intellectual, cultural, and social advancement achieved by the human race has come from those individuals that retained an iron will of independence. If I want to make any real, genuine changes in this world, this is a trait I must enforce. Assuming a more personal tone, my sense of empathy is a quality that defines my relationship with others. Much of my life has been marred with turmoil and tumult, from my alcoholic mother to my early memories living in poverty. I have often used these experiences as a way to channel support, both emotional and logical, into those for whom I care. For example, my parents nearly got divorced over a series of martial struggles, and as a result, I knew how to talk to a friend who was undergoing the same issue. He, like I did, had a gut-wrenching fear that life would never be the same, that his beloved familial structure would come to ruin. Years later, he often thanks me for being the only one able to help him through that time. I knew what it was like then, and I didn't want anyone else to feel that aura of despair I once did. My friends and family mean the absolute world to me. I seek to be the kind of support structure for others that I have rarely been able to count upon. By underlining my attributes as an individual, rather than a mere applicant, I hope I have revealed myself to be a desirable candidate for admission to your institution. I am a technically attuned, intellectually curious, and gracious soon-to-be freshman. Given the opportunity, I know that I can bring much to my future collegiate environment while also coming away a better, more enriched person for the experience."
"My ideal college environment would be one that is completely different from what was my high school situation, as there I was not afforded with very many enriching opportunities. At my ideal college, I want to be surrounded by a diverse variety of intellectuals that praise education as much as I have throughout my lifetime. I want a school bearing amazing professors, unmatched in both their acumen and charisma. I want the university to offer plenty of opportunities to be able to commit myself to service and activity. From the aforementioned amenities, I hope to truly better myself through entertaining newfound experiences and perspectives. After all, I consider that to be the goal of any exemplary institution of learning."
"One of the many things that separates humans from other animals is our ability to think. Knowledge, in essence, is what makes us human. I like to think that the pursuit of additional knowledge is not only enjoyable but an action that strengths the inner self. Rather than pursuits of physical expertise, I instead focus on the mind, and through that I gain the serenity that others who pursue a familiar hobby receive. While most of my peers thought school to be boring, I would be the student reading ahead in the textbook, often in awe of the information I was learning. I like the unexplained to become explained."
"Only fourteen years of age, I sat across from my Nana at an oddly placed table, staring at a piece of fried fish in front of me that I had not touched. My foot tapped a repetitive beat on the grungy tile as I waited. My sixteen-year-old sister, Faith, walked out of the run-down gas station bathroom as we turned toward her, eager, yet terrified, to hear the result. ""It's positive,"" she mumbled. I felt sick to my stomach. A typical individual would look at this scenario with empathy and pity my sister, the poor teenage girl whose life was about to take a dramatic turn because of one imprudent action, but while I gazed at that lifeless fish my mind was only turned inward: Great, our house would have that repulsive spoiled-milk-featuring-dirty-diaper smell. How could I do hours of homework with a baby's scream as background music? What would people think of me, the little sister of a pregnant sophomore? For days I avoided eye contact with the girl who single-handedly shamed our entire family. Weeks later I was beginning to completely shut Faith out when two short, yet life-changing sentences were thrown around at a nearby lunchroom table. ""Yeah, she's sixteen and I heard she's pregnant. What a whore."" This demeaning term was not used to describe my sister, but to label another pregnant teen in the community. Nonetheless if they thought that of her, what did they think of my sister? Across the world, I believe every person could hear the wall of self-pity and selfishness that I unknowingly built in my head crumble. It was time for me to grow up. Eight months after Faith's shocking disclosure, the world met Aliyah Grace Wood and I quickly took up the role that her father would have had if he were in the picture. I am not the perfect aunt by a long shot; I have put on a fair share of lopsided or backwards diapers and misplaced several pacifiers in times of need, but as Aliyah transitioned from a five-pound preemie to a chubby-faced toddler, I transitioned from a self-absorbed teen to an individual my family views as a responsible adult. Not only have I learned how to care for children, I have learned how to put the needs of others before my wants. A few weeks after Aliyah was born, it became a normal routine to be awake at 3:00 am taking turns rocking her, getting a few hours shut-eye, and waking up early enough to help dress her for daycare before I began to get myself dressed for school. Did I particularly enjoy having my shirt frequently soiled by spit-up or canceling plans to babysit? Of course not. Nonetheless I found - and continue to find - myself in these circumstances due to my newfound maturity and the love I have for my niece's bubbly laugh and unruly curls. When Aliyah was around a year old, life reminded me that I always had to be on my toes: Faith was pregnant again... SURPRISE! I would once again be inconspicuously leaving the room when a diaper soaked through to my shirt and holding a baby with one arm while eating with the other. What was the difference? This time I was ready."
"In tenth grade, I stumbled across ""Richard Cory,"" a short poem by Edwin Robinson that tells the story of a wealthy gentleman who seems happy and is deeply envied by the townspeople, but on ""one calm summer night, [he goes] home and [puts] a bullet through his head."" Many people have shamed this poem due to its depressing nature, yet I believe it is Robinson's haunting truthfulness that makes this poem beautiful. Anyone, including myself, is able to relate to the hard-hitting message: appearances can be deceiving and inner turmoil is not something that the world can see. In my mind, every individual is comprised of layers of stories and laughter and pain, and nothing calls attention to those deepest layers as well as the tale of Richard Cory."
"I can only compare the gaining of knowledge to the feeling of crossing into another state; I become completely silent and my eyes triple in size, in awe of my new surroundings. Then take that feeling and amplify it until it morphs into crossing into outer space- perhaps even another planet. Since my passion lies in the field of astrophysics, this feeling is no metaphor. All the information I soak in enables me to understand the world beyond us. However, it is the potentiality of discovery that excites me the most, and I certainly dream of the day I contribute to our understanding of the universe and mankind's place in it, which is what motivates me to learn."
"Watching a grove of towering trees race by my car window, I observed a wild goat grazing peacefully in their shade. I couldn't help but notice the stark contrast between this and the city I was driving away from, where concrete pathways reigned and the only animals in sight had leashes attached to them. I experienced this contrast due to my parents, and the differences between them. They were opposites in many ways, such as their level of education, socio-economic status, and hometown. Instead of creating conflict, it is this contrast which gives me serenity, and which was responsible for molding me into what I am today. My country has one of the most culturally diverse societies in the world, and I am a great example of that. Black father; white mother. He never finished high school; she has a bachelor's degree in Education. In fact, her father was the Minister of Education. The family I grew up with in my early years was my mother's own. Among these devout Roman Catholics was my great uncle, who was the Archbishop of the country for many years. My grandfather, before entering politics, was the principal of one of the most prestigious secondary schools in the country, and my own alma mater. This was a family with a focus on success: academic, financial and otherwise. Social status was a given; popularity was understood, particularly in the urban areas. As I made the transition into the rural community of Tabaquite where my father was born, I quickly noticed the difference in attitudes held by the two halves of my family. People from these areas experience life at a much slower pace. Only one member of his family is college educated, most of the rest shied away from such aspirations. No one is renowned across the country for anything at all. Family is what matters most to them, and family involves just about anyone in the community. They make money only to support themselves and the people they live with, and of my father's siblings, none left the community, preferring to settle nearby. By the time I met them, I was already 10 years old, and felt like somewhat of a stranger during visits. Ironically, it was one of these visits that would change my outlook on life forever. My uncle, Frank, characterized by his comically large stomach, wears a shirt on only two occasions: hospital visits, and church (a rare occurrence). He was telling a story of one such occasion, and had us all rolling with laughter. I looked around me, at all of these genuinely happy and loving people, not buoyed by any awards or status or measurable success, and I think I found the purpose of life. I had spent my whole life believing that I would be remembered by my palpable achievements and success. At that point, I realized that being happy and making the people around me happy was just as important as anything else. Thanks to my unique background of seemingly opposite influences, I had found my ""yin yang"", and I knew what I was born to do. It must seem to many both arrogant and naive that, in my seventeenth year, I claim to know the meaning of life; a conundrum that has baffled the most intelligent minds on the planet for all of eternity. Perhaps they are right, but I approach each challenge in my life with confidence and optimism, and find great peace in doing so. Thanks to my parents, I possess a drive for success that has led me to this point and will lead me onward, yet I refuse to let failure and adversity bog me down, because I know what is important."
"What isn't an important challenge facing my generation? In truth, the future seems dire. Civil war tearing countries apart while mainstream media seems to ignore it, refugees and the less fortunate being ignored in a sickly inhumane manner, climate change threatening the end of our days while the greedy elite deny its existence; pick your poison. The issue which is going to be ignored, though, is the fact that, in the midst of tragedy, we all need to stay positive, or risk losing our humanity. While we fight tooth and nail to combat the evils that plague our society, we need to remind ourselves that there is good in our world, and there is a lot of it. Even in the search for a utopian society, when we ignore the beauty in the world today, we're just missing the point, aren't we?"
"I chose this prompt, not in spite of the fact, but rather because it is a difficult one for me to answer. It intrigues me, but having thought about it, my answer is: How could i not be motivated to learn? It's an innate desire to learn which motivates me, a desire I was surprised to learn everyone didn't share. Looking at the world around me, I feel a desperate need to know how it all works, however intricately it does. The most interesting subject for me is Maths, but in truth i could study anything. How people communicate, how ecosystems work, how the stars move. As long as i'm still learning, i'm happy."
"In the back of the ambulance, my heart rate elevated and I was sweating profusely. My mind was racing. How far were we from the hospital? What would my mother say when I told her what happened that night? Experienced medics started IVs and performed EKGs, frantically yet seamlessly working around me. A life hung in the balance. Thankfully, it was not my life. This was my first ambulance ride-along for my EMT certification. Six months earlier, I enrolled in an EMT class because I was looking for a meaningful volunteer opportunity that would cater to my interest in medicine. Attacking the behemoth textbook one page at a time, I attended EMT training twice a week on top of my junior year course load, memorizing anatomy, generic and trade names for drugs, and maladies that sounded like they came straight out of The Lord of the Rings. Towards the end of the course, I was extremely confident in my newfound knowledge. As the only high schooler in the class, I proved myself to my initially skeptical instructor, who later said I was one of the brightest students she's ever taught. The only obstacle standing in the way of my certification was ten patient interactions during ride-alongs. At the time, the requirement seemed like just a check in a box. After riding on several 18:00-6:00 shifts, I would be one step closer to my certification. Even though I had essentially memorized the textbook, I was nervous. It was not that I didn't know what to do. I felt like a doctor from Grey's Anatomy - thankfully scope-of-practice laws prevent me from acting like one. Nor was it the gore that made me nervous. I had previously shadowed surgeons, participated in dissections in school, and even donated to the school blood drive; I'm one of those people who is captivated, not petrified, by the needle entering the vein. I was, however, nervous about the uncertainty of what I may encounter. While the bloodied patient lay on the stretcher, unconscious, vulnerable, and ""circling the drain,"" as the paramedic put it, all the EMTs worked methodically to stabilize him until we reached the hospital. Meanwhile, I was sitting in the corner of the ambulance, stunned at how little I actually knew. While important, memorizing skills sheets for tests failed to prepare me for real-world experiences. Completely in control of the situation, the veteran EMTs worked as a single unit, handling each situation as it arose. Perhaps the most memorable detail from that night was the patient's complexion: grey as ash. No classroom can prepare you for the visage of impending death. I realized that this is why the state mandates prospective EMTs participate in ride-alongs: to expose them to actual patients, not hypothetical textbook examples. I compared my experience on the ambulance to the classroom and noticed that there is a disconnect, not in my knowledge base - I knew how to treat the patient -, but in the execution and improvisation required to be an effective emergency healthcare provider. These crucial skills unfortunately cannot be taught in the classroom. Because of this, after obtaining my certification, I joined a local volunteer rescue squad to continue my education through experience, learning and improving upon the practical skills necessary for success in this field. Recognizing that this gap between learning and experience is not just present in healthcare, I also pursued a research internship to bridge the gap between the science classroom and practical application. I realized that education is not finite, but must be continued through lifelong experience in order to gain a true understanding of how the world works. Bridging the expanse between the classroom and the world beyond those walls is critical to true understanding, which is why I continue to actively pursue opportunities to increase my experience and knowledge."
"Whenever a book is adapted into a movie, there will always be two camps that emerge. One claims that the book is better than the movie and the other attests the exact opposite. But what happens when they both hold equal merit? So far, this has happened only once to me: when I read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey and watched its film adaptation directed by Milos Forman. What drew me in most is the main character, McMurphy. The novel is often on banned book lists because of its lewd content, but this is actually crucial to the story. Profanity and sexuality are used to develop the main character's free-spirited nature. Through McMurphy's ""inappropriate behavior"" in a mental institution, valuable lessons about free-thinking and nonconformity are taught. I learned that nothing can be taken at face value. Everything merits scrutiny, especially the status quo."
"I didn't understand why my father was crying. As a fourth grader, not being invited to a birthday party was the most tragedy I've experienced, so I couldn't begin to comprehend that my sister was being hospitalized for pneumonia. As we drove to the PICU where my sister was, I began to cry as well, not knowing what else to do. Looking back, I realized that this is where my interest in medicine started. Though her illness was distressing, watching her resilience as she recovered with the help of her doctors and the support of my parents inspired me to become a physician. In pursuing this goal, I'm trying to relive the wonder of her recovery in a sense. This is what I look forward to most about being a doctor: watching and sharing in my patients' recoveries from what may be the most vulnerable point in their lives."
"College is the one thing that almost every high schooler looks forward to, whether it be getting that letter of acceptance from the college of your dreams or moving across the country to start your new life. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to do one of these things, and that be move across the country. Unfortunately, I was about to start a life that was not mine. Move in day rapidly approached as all my friends packed up their rooms and jolted towards their new homes. Yet only one thing was missing, I was not in that same boat. My college acceptance process did not go as hoped, but I refused to see anything wrong with that. I was accepted into a few schools of which I was not particularly sure I could see myself at, and certainly not one school that I loved. Day after day, I forced myself to act as if Chapman University was the place that I wanted to spend the next four years of my life at. Coming from a profound boarding school in the northwest corner of Connecticut, I felt as if I was obligated to go to college even if I failed to get into many of my top choices. I was frustrated and upset when the acceptance letters rolled through in mid-march, but I did not let anyone see those emotions out of me. I felt ashamed that I was denied from the schools that I was interested in and I was afraid that my peers would judge me if I took time off. Therefor, I didn't know any better than to follow through and act like I belonged in Southern California. Stepping onto the campus of Chapman University in the sunny heart of Orange, California was like paradise for most incoming freshman, but for me it was the opposite. I did not feel the excitement that my peers did during orientation week and I certainly did not feel at home. I soon realized that I still had the chance to change my destiny, and I was not willing to let anyone stand in my way. In order to do so, I returned home and wiped my plate clean. Taking a gap year has allowed me to work for my parent's business, giving me the opportunity to mature as a young woman and find what it is that I really want to do with my life. I have learned from this experience that you must always trust your gut, no matter the outcome, regardless of what others may think of you. Although someone may tell you that you that must do something because society views it as politically correct, does not mean you must do it. Nothing in life is ever set in stone, and I was lucky enough to learn that at a very young age. With that being said, I will do anything in my power to live my life the way I want, and the way I believe will make me the happiest. Attending the college of my dreams is just the beginning."
"I am extremely passionate about the subject of genetically modified foods, as I believe they are an important challenge facing my generation, and I would love to have the opportunity to immerse myself with other students who are just as passionate about this topic. Industrial agriculture is one of earth's biggest harms right now, not only due to the continuous production of GMO seeds, but also because of the damage it is causing our environment. With the addition of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere, we are essentially aiding climate change. Farming has become so unnatural that it is toxic to both the earth and humans. It needs to return to its original, unindustrialized, healthy self and anything we can do at Emory, such as planting our own food in a small garden, will help bring awareness."
"Emory University is a place that I can, without a doubt, see myself at for the next four years of my life. My ideal campus would allow me to develop as a thinker. I want to have the ability to recognize the way I think, which in return may have to start with redefining the way I interpret certain instances that occur in my everyday life. In doing so, at Emory, I want to make the best of every situation in order to foster my critical thinking. Whether I get a bad grade on a test or get irritated because I can't seem to grasp an essay prompt, I want to turn my frustrations into opportunities that I can learn from. I want to persevere through everything that I put my mind to, working towards self-improvement, and I believe Emory would be the place to do so."
"A thick crowd of two thousand people watches my every move. I'm their enemy. My only weapon is a TI-84 graphing calculator. As an incendiary attack, I bend over and type in an exaggerated way. Beside me, my only ally pulls out a tape measure and tries to calculate in the air, ridiculously intent. It was all an act, of course. If I was really their enemy, I'd be at a tremendous disadvantage, grossly outnumbered and wearing a thick, rounded pair of glasses that made it impossible to see clearly. I was playing a part in the school pep rally as an academically-focused rival school. We were about to be defeated by the mightiness of our school spirit, trying to be as gawky and ineffectively nerdy as possible. I definitely fit the bill, costumed in glasses I hadn't worn much since middle school, and an unquestionably nerdy outfit. I was a caricature of an intellectual but underneath that I was the real thing. I don't tuck a button-down into shorts that I pull up past my waist or walk around carrying a graphing calculator, but I do love learning. Recently, I was asked what my perfect day would be like without school. The question threw me because my perfect day probably would include a few hours of learning in an environment surrounded by friends - basically school. Still, I'm not a freak of nature who enjoys grinding out equations for hours while everyone else plays in the sunshine and enjoys life. I hate extra work and the repetitive struggle of homework as much as the next kid. There's just a simple pleasure in a new discovery, when something clicks and all the pieces fall into place, and I understand the world better than I did before. I enjoy science, history, math, English, languages and pretty much every other elective I've taken. I'll let you in on a little secret about school subjects: they're all the same. The content is a slight variation on the same ideas and patterns. Double negatives cancel out just as well in math as they do in English. Teasing the derivative out of an inverse trigonometric function is remarkably similar to digging the symbolism out of Kate Chopin's ""The Storm,"" which is almost the same as working out a formula for how inertia and gravity create elliptical orbits. The forces of wind and water that create continually cyclic atmospheric conditions are similar to the forces of ideology and discontent that drive repeating political movements throughout history. In my spare time, I read books on everything from economics to neuroscience to chicken breeds. I'll have trouble deciding my major in college. I could quadruple major but I likely wouldn't have learned everything I wanted to. In middle school, I enjoyed being the know-it-all. I liked the feeling of my impressed classmates asking me how I did it. My hand shot up in class as soon as I knew the answer to something. I won a quiz bowl championship in eighth grade thanks to my lightning fast reflexes. What an arrogant dork. Learning is worthwhile for its own sake. And learning is more worthwhile when you use it to help other people. I first understood that I could share ideas well and help others get the material during freshman year in a really difficult math class. My brain felt as though it was being squeezed like the last of a toothpaste tube. Fortunately, being momentarily helpless let me empathize with the people sitting next to me. When a concept clicked, I explained it to other students. I passed on my excitement for math. The class connected me to my community in a way I hadn't been connected before, where I could infuse the people around me with a love of learning. Connections create meaning in life."
"To put our generation's number one challenge in the words of former president Bill Clinton, ""It's the economy, stupid."" An increasingly globalized world presents complex economic questions with no easy answers. Our generation's task will be to answer them. Whether countries ought to open themselves up to free trade to or employ protectionist policies, whether policymakers should implement austerity or stimulus, and whether markets ought to be socialist or capitalist are tough decisions that affect millions of jobs, billions of products and trillions of dollars. Setting a good economic policy can break the cycle of poverty, decrease international tension or promote fiscal growth. Unfortunately, these objectives sometimes lie at odds with each other. Deciding which economic features we value will define the future at a time where economic policies are high changeable due to disruption from a surge of globalization. Our choices set a precedent; we're up for the challenge."
"The King's Speech is an elegant, emotional movie about King George VI's struggle with his family, country and stutter. Lionel, his snarky speech therapist befriends him as England is on the cusp of WWII and in the midst of a power transfer from his father to his brother. At first George struggles to let Lionel address his speech impediment, but Lionel's persistence wins the prince over. The conclusion is uplifting; the newly coronated King George smoothly makes full speech with Lionel by his side. As someone who used to have difficulty speaking, I find the movie to be powerfully inspiring and insightful. I empathize with George's shame and rejoice with his success. Ultimately, the movie offers the greatest gift a movie can give: hope. The final moments of the movie are rich with hope for George to overcome his stutter and hope for viewers to overcome any problem they face."
"I grew up on a narrow street in Petite Martinique, Grenada. It was not just physically narrow, but also symbolically narrow. The word narrow could be used to represent the tight sense of closeness that the members of my community shared. Moreover, in my eyes, the word narrow mirrored the mentality of my community. Everyone shared the same perspectives-something was either ""normal"" and accepted or ""not normal"" and criticized. These perspectives included expectations of what every neighborhood child's life should be like-what my life should be like. However, I learned very early on that I wanted more. When I was a child, the girls and boys in my neighborhood would spend most of their time playing outside while I would stay indoors reading and writing poems. I did not see the importance of playing, I preferred to build up my reading and writing skills instead. The girls, more than the boys, would always make fun of me for reading and writing because I was not doing the things that girls were supposed to do. Unlike the other children in my neighborhood, my ambitions were beyond their expectations. So, when I got the opportunity to come to America, I acted upon it. When I landed in America, I quickly realized how different it was from Grenada. Not many people took the time to appreciate their surroundings, or speak to each other. The sense of community that I was used to no longer existed in my new environment. When I started attending school, the other students were not welcoming or friendly. However, I continued to act as I was taught. In Grenada, I had been taught that respect and discipline are the two key aspects of being successful in school and life. It was the norm to show respect for your elders and the people around you. My respect for others and myself has also made me more disciplined in my actions and interactions. With these values instilled in me, I was able to build relationships with my teachers, peers, and other people that I have encountered. Both the value of respect and my outgoing personality have helped me to obtain numerous leadership positions during my high school career. I was the tenth grade representative of student government in 2013. I am currently the president of the National Honor Society: Ujima Chapter. As president, I became more immersed within my community and learned that I am passionate about helping children that are less fortunate than I am. My passion for helping others have motivated me to start a service project by collecting school supplies and donations to donate to an underprivileged school in Ghana. When I grew up in Grenada, I felt restricted by my environment and the mentality of the people but I am also very grateful for it because it has shaped me into the strong, respected, goal-oriented, and outgoing person that I am today. As a young lady applying to American colleges I am aware yet proud of my strengths and work ethics. Thus far, I have achieved so much and I will continue to remind myself of that narrow street in Petite Martinique as I navigate through college and explore new and exciting opportunities."
"In 50 years, my generation will encounter the complexity of teaching a diverse classroom. With each passing year, Western countries are becoming more diverse; the citizens of western countries are forced to open up their hearts and minds to include the influx of ethnicities and cultures that cross our borders each year.The one place that most of these cultures converge is in the classroom, and teachers are going to be faced with the challenge of relating and connecting students in a multiethnic classroom. One of the challenges would be embracing the students similarities, rather than highlighting their differences. Today, our country is somewhat divided in a number of areas especially race and religion, and there is no evidence that this factor is going to change anytime soon.While it will be difficult to engage multiethnic classrooms, the challenges would be worth it."
"I was born and raised in Grenada, an Afro-Caribbean island. When I came to Brooklyn, both my middle school and high school were made up of mostly Caribbean, Afro-Caribbean, and African-American students. The communities I grew up and live in are not diverse and was a key factor that was lacking in my upbringing. Thus, diversity is a big factor in the school I choose to attend. I am looking for a college where I can meet people of other cultures, religions, and philosophies. I am interested in a place where I can celebrate my identity while also embracing those identities that differ from it. I long to experience Italian culture through your Italian Studies Program so that I can immerse myself in the culture. I want to understand our current society through numerous interdisciplinary lenses, perspectives, and global contexts. By attending Emory University, I can fulfill my potential."
"When I was five, my mother told me about Santa Claus. She asked me to clean my most-frequently-worn shoes and place them in front of my bedroom on Christmas Eve, so Santa could put my presents near them. How my family must have chuckled to see me eagerly scrubbing my sneakers, carefully hanging them up so they could dry in time, and neatly placing them in front of my bedroom. At night I would close my eyes and wish. I would concentrate so hard I thought my brain would explode, just to make sure Santa would hear me. I wished for the next volume of my favorite science comic series, a colored-pencil palette, or a painting canvas. Sometimes, I wondered if he could make my bigger wishes come true. Then I wished Santa would bring Dad home from work in time for the new year. I wished for a special medicine that could ease Mom's back pain. And I wished for a car, so Mom wouldn't be soaked riding her motorbike on rainy days. On Christmas morning, a neatly wrapped present would be placed beside my shoes. I would proudly bring it to class, telling everyone that it was from Santa. ""That's definitely from your parents. Santa doesn't exist!"" A boy responded curtly. ""What do you know about Santa?"" I snorted. No one could destroy my perfect image of him. The boy knew more than I did, apparently. Only when I was twelve did I find out the truth. Disappointed and upset, I tried to give up on the magical world of free gifts. However, my faith in Santa was so deeply rooted that parts of that belief are still alive in me today. Sometimes, I'd still make grand wishes to him, not for me, but for others. I wished Santa cured all the patients of their illnesses. I wished he provided education to every child. And I wished he gave nourishment to those in need. I soon realized I don't need to give up on Santa Claus. Instead, I could be the bridge between magic and reality, bringing happiness to others around me. Santa thus becomes a flame that kindles my confidence, and I decided to become my own version of him. Just like Santa ignites hope with his letters to children, I'm a frequent pen pal, despite half the earth's distance, to a little patient with inherited disorder I met during a cross-country service trip. After learning of his sad stories, I reached out to people in rural areas of Vietnam, hoping to raise compassion, and eventually improve the lives of patients like him. Just like Santa embodies unconditional affection for children, I genuinely love the underclassmen I tutored. As a teaching assistant for my chemistry teacher, I stayed up late to prepare for my 'lectures,' finding funny ways to approach my lessons. I soon became their respected older sister, juggling between my work and countless requests to cover their classes. Just like Santa happily stains himself climbing down hundreds of chimneys, I learn to put others' needs before my own. That means spoiling my tutees with Snickers and Reese's. That means bringing two suitcases full of Vietnamese snacks to share with my classmates, even when I had no space left for my favorites. And that means cooking Vietnamese soup for my homesick juniors despite the six-hour process. When I realized it was my mother all this time who gave presents to me, I thought I would forever give up on my magical world. Paradoxically, as I grow up, my faith in Santa, instead of being dimmed, is further ignited. I realize I don't need to wear a white beard and a bright red coat to embrace the world with affection and generosity. I don't need flying wagons and red-nose Rudolphs to create magic. With t-shirt, jeans, and love, in my very own way, I'm Santa Claus."
"As I spent many years in Vietnam's constricted environment, a liberal approach to learning is extremely important for me to be fully in control of my education. My goal is to bring quality, accessible healthcare for others. With Emory's vast catalog, interdisciplinary courses like 'Health, History and Culture' will help me better understand the current state of Vietnamese healthcare through historical lessons in medicine. Lectures in 'Core issues in Global Health' will expand my understanding of global health priorities and challenges in implementing solution, opening my mind to healthcare issues not only in Vietnam but also in America. I also look forward to building on my passion in services. With my experience of tutoring elementary and middle schoolers, I hope to join the Center for Science Education, mentoring juniors in science subjects. I endeavor to contribute to Emory and its surrounding community, building inclusive, enduring relationships with like-minded students."
"I eagerly turned the knob on the spectrophometer, feeling twenty pairs of eyes fixated on me. It was the fifth time I changed a variable to show my juniors possible outside effects on measurements. Finally, I exhaled. I had covered everything I wanted. As a teaching assistant, I had gone beyond theoretical requirements to show how the experiment worked in non-ideal conditions. As they clapped excitedly, I smiled. This wasn't my first attempt at experimenting and teaching, yet every time had been as thrilling. I had spent hours in the lab fiddling with the machine, hoping to shed new light on experiments, so I can challenge my underclassmen to think in multiple perspectives. I enjoy finding different solutions to my questions, complicating problems, and daring myself to find the answers. To me, learning is about both appreciating new knowledge, and sharing my knowledge to engage others in stretching our minds."
"Getting education was out of dream in my family. There was someone, social worker who stepped on our veranda as an illuminator in my early life. He observed our unfavorable condition and promised that he would help me admit in primary school with free of cost. School was nearby home so feeling secure, my family agreed to send me school. Then my life started getting new moment. With lots of ups and down, I finished high school level education with remarkable position. I am continuously taught about the importance of education and responsibilities towards society by my family and teachers. As I am an elder son, I have to help my parents and especially totally blind grandmother in house and in field besides education. My extreme pleasure is that grandmother sees the world through my eyes. It is difficult to go with study and work at the same time, but I learnt at the age of 10. I am used to working in the field to grow crops with my father, helping my mother vend milk in the diary daily in the morning, and studying in the school. However, I always tried to excel in every field. After my high school study I got an opportunity to expose me in society. I involved in number of voluntary services initiated by various organizations at National, regional and village level. Tree plantation program, river cleaning campaign, door to door polio drop program, blood donation program, and illiterate reduction effort were among most important social works. During these philanthropic calendars, I was inspired by personalities of various people from different walk of life. I pondered and analyzed the true nature of human being. I understood great humans come to this world for lessen or root out suffering of living things. This thought made us become selflessness. When government of Nepal started an initiative to make our country 100 percent literate by organizing ""Education for All"" and ""Education for Elderly"", I motivated my villagers to participate in that program. It is very ideal long term program and all Nepali have to play their role in various levels to achieve. So I also started to give free tuition to all children from underprivileged family in my village. In this purpose, our village team got an opportunity to serve for the children who were deprived of education. At that time, our mission was to raise fund for buying text books for the students of remote village. After working continuously for 10 days, we were able to raise NRs. 220000, (USD $2095 equivalent). We felt enormous happiness when those students smiled after getting books in their hands. Natural disaster tested my achievements in the practical field when my country was hit by great earthquake, 7.8 magnitudes in Richter scale on April 25, 2015. Many houses were destroyed including mine and thousands of people lost their life. Then I took part in clearing debris of village house and UNESCO heritage sites, involved in reconstruction structures, involved in blood donation campaign and helped various social organizations supply basic needs to affected people. I realized the duty of true citizen. I participated in Fulbright Opportunity Funding (OF), USEF-Nepal, program for 2016. I was delighted when I was chosen in this program. I got more exposure and learned valuable things from OF that added more value in my life. Now I am thinking of what role I can play for society if I get an opportunity to study in US after I come back Nepal."
"Internet has become a bane to the people living in rural areas. PC and Internet are connecting world. According to Friedman, the world is becoming flat because of it, but still many people in the rural areas are living in the darkness which is because of absence of Internet. Living in the rural areas, I have always become far from 'Internet', newspaper, and magazine; however, I prefer to read ""Reader's Digest"" for my personal satisfaction. My affection towards it grew stronger after I read ""If pro and con are opposite, Is congress opposite of progress?"" in Reader's Digest. ""The Basic Works of Aristotle"" by Richard McKeon is one of the wonderful books I have read. It taught me that philosophy, literature, and science have interrelated roots in human imagination."
"I am used to opening machines, but could never understand what is inside the chip, microprocessor, and IC. I was always trying to see how I could connect machines and aid in the betterment of mankind. I do exercises in the mornings. The very best thing I do in the morning is loosening screws, when I should not vend milk in the dairy, of the machine. I would always wonder ""what will happen if I connect these two wires?"" Sometimes I used to get electric shock, but it has always attracted me towards technology. The electric shocks refresh and energize me. After I worked as an electrician for five months, I became well acquainted with my real passion: Electrical Engineering. During those months, the days were considerably shorter than the nights."
"""You have never eaten ?Banku' before"" exclaimed one of my classmates at my new boarding school in Ghana. When I replied no, all of my classmates looked at me in disbelief. She then asked me if we had food back home because she believed that every African eats ?banku'. This experience made me realize how individuals can be so engulfed by their own society, that they are completely shut out from the world around them. Born and raised in Ethiopia, I had no knowledge of other cultures in society. Growing up in a homogenous society, I never had the opportunity to participate in cultural exchange, therefore moving to Ghana for boarding school gave me this chance. I had always longed to teach others about my culture while simultaneously learning about their culture. The first experience I had in discovering a new culture, occurred four years ago, when I convinced my dad to take me and my siblings on a trip to the rural part of Ethiopia to experience life like the locals. We went to Were Babo, which is a town in the northern part of Ethiopia.This trip was the first time I challenged myself by stepping out of my comfort zone because I was going to a place with scarce electricity and limited access to clean water. During this trip, I never felt like a foreigner because I was still in an Ethiopian environment and was surrounded by my family members. But deciding to come to Ghana to school for a year was a huge transition for me. Not only was I being brought out of my comfort zone in Ethiopia, I was going there all alone. Needless to say, I was excited to discover the Ghanaian way of life but very nervous. The biggest challenge I faced at my new boarding school was being away from home. For the past eighteen years , I spent most of my time at home or at school. My parents way of protecting me was by monitoring my movements. This meant that in most situation they were the ones who made decisions for me. Whenever I wanted to do something I would have to always ask them for permission or assistance with making a decision. Being sheltered by my parents made me become dependent on them. Whenever I faced a problem, I would go running to my parents because I knew they would fix it for me. As time went by, I realized that my dependency on them was an issue and I wanted to change that. As part of the change, I asked my parents to give me a curfew, so that I could go out and discover more of town. When I shared my plan with them they were not convinced, but I went ahead with it.The results motivated me to go ahead with my second plan which was to study abroad. When I mentioned my plans to them they advised me to concentrate on applying to the universities back home, so I secretly applied to a boarding school in Ghana. Fortunately, I was accepted and I couldn't keep it a secret from them any longer. I still remember the look on their face when I told them; they couldn't believe a word I was saying. Since I had come this far they couldn't say no, so they allowed me to make my own decision. I was delighted; that was one of the happiest moments of my life. Finally, I came to Ghana. Coming to Ghana was the best decision I have ever made. Here, I don't have my parents to run to when I face a problem; rather I have to come up with a solution on my own. Since I came here I have been more independent and been able to learn more about the Ghanaian culture while teaching mine. I hope to do the same in university."
"For the past seventeen years I had lived in Ethiopia. I was the surrounded by a homogeneous society, so I only knew the Ethiopian way of life. Fortunately, this year I am schooling at African Science Academy, a school for girls all over Africa. I have met girls coming from Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, Cameroon and Sierra Leon. This opportunity has allowed me to experience the western African culture and see that it was really different from the East African culture, even though both are found in Africa. In my college experience I am looking forward to meet new people from different cultural back grounds. By moving to a new continent I hope to be aware of more cultures and at the same time teach mine to others. I believe as I become more aware of the different cultures around me I will be a well rounded person."
"I read purple Hibiscus upon a recommendation of my mentor. So far it is the best book I have ever read. This book is my favorite because it narrates the realities of an African family. Even though the colonialism ended ages ago, its scars are still apparent today. Most Africans think"" Western is superior"" to this day. This can be seen in the book when papa says speak English like a civilized man. In addition, everything you do should make your family proud and in accordance to the norms of the society. There are times you have to act certain way just because the society thinks it is right. For Kambili and Jaja they are expected to only follow Papa's footsteps. To ensure this, he writes their schedules and punishes them severely if they fail to follow. Purple hibiscus portrays the true Africa and for this reason it's my favorite."
"""Chicken or pasta, sir?"" The blond, blue-eyed flight attendant asked. ""Chicken, please!"" I ecstatically replied with a feeling of accomplishment. At that moment, I would have enjoyed eating anything. What excited me most was the special ingredient in that question: the English language. I grew up well aware of life's boundaries. I was fascinated by my wealthier cousin's opportunities - from swimming classes to the new Playstation 1, from studying at a private school to a vast collection of Pokemon dolls. Eager to glimpse a simple nod of possibility, I would look to my mother, asking for a simple nod of ""yes"" to the experiences I craved. But I would always hear her gentle reply: ""It is out of our reach, my son."" I would run into those words countless times on my journey. In fifth grade, I sat speechless at my rusty desk, staring at five native English speakers visiting my school. For the first time, although the only English words I knew were ""lion"" and how to count up to 10, I suddenly understood that a different, bigger world existed beyond what I knew. I felt an inner urge to join that international community. But a voice whispered. ""It is out of our reach."" Yet, along this mysterious road of life, I met people who nudged me onto paths of opportunity. In high school, encouraged by my math teacher, I was accepted to one of the best public schools in Brazil. In this new setting, desks were not rusty, labs were well-equipped, and noisy fans were replaced by air conditioners in non-cracked walls. An environment that I had only dreamed of was now my daily life. ""Yes, I can reach!"" I shouted at my surrounding circumstances. Sophomore year, I started teaching myself English. By listening to my favorite songs and writing down what I heard, I trained my ear and learned to spell new words. Watching movies with subtitles helped me interpret conversations and speaking to myself in English enabled me to communicate more quickly. Slowly, my ""Tree"" became a ""THree,"" my words turned into sentences, and my home was colored by vocabulary flashcards. Unexpectedly, my growing English skills instilled in me the confidence to teach myself other subjects that had captivated me: calculus, French, musical scales and chords, astronomy, drawing techniques, biblical stories. As I began to open new doors of knowledge, everything seemed possible. English taught me to approach challenges with a new motto: If life does not give you the tool, make it yourself. My conversation with the blond, blue-eyed flight attendant was a celebration of my struggles to fly beyond my borders. That day, I was heading to Yale University to participate, with full tuition, in a selective summer program. There, I was no longer a speechless boy, but an active learner, doing my best to express myself among English speakers from all over the world. While there, through the constant stream of supportive messages from friends and family back home, I realized that even as I journeyed into this new world, I was not leaving Brazil. I was carrying it along with me. I dream of a day when students' futures will not be defined by socioeconomic backgrounds, hope will not be stymied by frustration, and smiles of courage will replace tears of despair. What was first only a daydream to learn English materialized into an insatiable yearning to grow and explore. Each time I pass a barrier, I only feel stronger. Now, whenever I look into my mother's green eyes, what I see is the certainty that her son will continue achieving his ""unreachable"" aspirations. Now, I glimpse a new reality in her words. ""It is within your reach, my son!"""
"I was 13 when I found purpose in the Bible. I became the lone Protestant in a Catholic family, inspired by stories of Samuel, David, and Jeremiah to believe in my decisions. At 14, I began preaching in my church, encouraging congregants to abandon hopelessness and embrace diversity. I accepted invitations to preach elsewhere, and even joined one family at a hospital, where their relative was in a coma. Sharing the story of Lazarus, who died but was resurrected, I provided comfort that faith creates miracles while giving us strength to let loved ones go. The Bible is a compass for life's dilemmas. The renewed smiles I see after sermons, the privilege of spreading values that enhance our shared sense of humanity - respect for the LGBT community, tolerance for different religious groups, peace with each other - have no price. Whenever I hold the Bible, I hold my future."
"Whether I'm staying up until 2am, learning harmonic fields on my guitar; debating online with friends in Palestine, Mexico, or Ethiopia about the future of education; or using Socratic paideia in philosophical discussions at school to articulate perspectives on euthanasia, everything teaches me that I cannot limit myself to a single point of view. For me, teaching is the gift of learning twice. As a volunteer English teacher at my church, I work hard to explain complex concepts in simple terms. As a math tutor at my school, I help my peers see our world's numerical patterns. And as head astronomy tutor, I see students' questions as invitations to find new ways of analyzing problems. Curiosity drives my mind along unknown roads, toward understanding. At each journey's end - whether I'm absorbing cutting-edge scientific knowledge or exploring novel angles on timeless questions - I am never the same again."
"I have always been interested in true crime; my mother and I have spent countless nights together in the living room watching Investigation Discovery. This fascination with the criminal mind coupled with my uncanny love of romantic comedies created a perfect storm for a vague obsession with the trope of lovers on the lam. Then I saw the History channel miniseries about Bonnie and Clyde. What interested me most wasn't the crimes, or the guns, or the cars, or even the romance really, but rather the motivations behind these violent acts and robberies. The miniseries portrayed Clyde as a lovesick man who did anything his moll told him to do even if it meant the death of his older brother, fourteen policemen and civilians. While the idea of Bonnie as a manipulative mastermind makes for much better drama, the miniseries was slammed by historians for the many liberties they took with facts. After reading the short article about how the miniseries was as close to fiction as Star Wars, I was struck with curiosity. If Bonnie's hunger for fame wasn't responsible for the crimes, then what was. I went into full nerd research mode. After reading every book my library had on the gang and a few I ordered off of Amazon, I began to uncover an answer. The storyteller in me finally had a clear answer. Clyde was motivated by fear, anger, and revenge while Bonnie followed beside him for love. It had taken about two months of nonstop research to come up with an answer that satisfied me but I was hungry to find out more. I watched every interview, every movie and documentary, read every personal account, every article on them. Within three months of my initial viewing of the miniseries, I put together a full annotated timeline starting the day they met and ending the day they died. Every person they met, place they stayed, gas station they robbed. If it was recorded in history, I knew about it. I made contact with a the editor of Blanche Barrow's autobiography to verify and suggest improvements on my timeline. In May of my senior year, my family and I traveled to the town Bonnie and Clyde met their bloody deaths to participate in an annual festival held there for historians. I was fortunate enough to meet Clyde's nephew and Bonnie's niece, both were kind enough to tell me all the family stories they knew. After compiling all of the stories into the timeline, I created an annotated map for myself. I wasn't sure what to do with the information in my head. Instead of letting it just be something that takes up space in, I began writing. At first a fictionalized account to show what kind of people I think they were, then a movie, and finally a documentary that I will put on YouTube in short episodes. After meeting a now very close friend from Massachusetts, I volunteered countless hours with her as she put on the 2010 Broadway musical about the infamous pair. For four months in my senior year I helped obtain rights to the play, advertise and promote the GoFundMe page, design the poster and playbill, and then managed to convince my parents to let me go to Massachusetts to work as backstage crew to help the production run smoothly. In the past two years, I've learned much more about myself than I have about Bonnie or Clyde. I've learned how driven I can be and how to direct that towards things I want. I've learned that the feeling of satisfaction upon completing a particularly difficult project can't be matched. I've learned how to study so I will actually learn from the material instead of only memorizing facts."
"The most important challenge currently facing my generation is simply to live up to the potential we have. We are all capable of incredible things both as 'Millennials' and as individuals. Past generations have gone to the moon, invented the smartphone, created game changing masterpieces like Citizen Kane. There has been significant progress in the world in just the past few decades, but there is so much left to do in the world to make it safer, smarter, and cleaner for everyone to enjoy. My generation was lucky enough to have been born during a time of innovation and we have ample skill and opportunity to do amazing things. The biggest challenge any of us face is to live up to that potential."
"My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Not only does the series as a whole present the many different kinds of love there are in this world and that each type is just as important as the last, but Deathly Hallows teaches forgiveness. The concept is simple but many don't know how to forgive others. From the cultural aggression of the Hazaras in Afghanistan to the personal grudges I have, humans tend to have a natural predisposition against forgiving others. Some cases are admittedly more extreme than others, the previous examples for instance, but Harry forgives people repeatedly during the story. He forgives the man who raised him like a pig for slaughter, the family who never accepted them as their own, the man who betrayed his parents. Forgiving is what gives him the power to destroy Voldemort, who never loved and never forgave."
"Numbers have always fascinated me! As I learned, I found myself delving deeper into anything related to mathematics. It also began to occur to me how I could know that the mathematical knowledge I had acquired was true.I was accepting knowledge uncritically at face value, without bothering to ask why any particular theorem was true or false. In the classrooms, proofs of theorems were seldom analysed beyond the stated fact as high school academic learning is essentially driven by a national exam curriculum which does not leave much scope for a detailed examination. However, since this question had crept into my mind, I became restless to examine the 'truth' of the mathematical concepts that we were learning. I was in Grade 9. It was the month of December. The date, I can't recall, but it was 1 am. My parents were fast asleep in the next room and all I could hear were bats squealing. I realized that the only way to counter my doubts was by rigorously examining the alleged 'truth' of the theorems I had been taught. I picked the nearest notebook I could find and began penning basic theorems in geometry. First came the notion of angles. I began by studying parallel lines and verified all the properties of angles I could recall. Then came the triangles. My heart was racing as I scribbled down the most basic mathematics. However, this rhythm was broken by a problem. We had earlier been taught Heron's formula which was used to compute the area of triangles. In fact, we had been tested on its applications, but when I tried to prove it using basic algebra I was stuck. Maybe it required a different approach. Generally, whenever I get stuck I close my eyes and visualize the figure or the algebra. Somehow, this act brings life to them.The symbols are free to move in my head and there is more room for experimentation and manipulation.And of course, there is a dialogue established between me and these thoughts. In this case, I imagined the triangle with its sides labelled a, b and c. Then a line from one vertex hit the opposite side and this was the altitude. It was magical! The angles appeared by themselves and within no time the Algebra had begun. Except, this time, it lacked fluidity. There were too many variables and no matter where they flew, I could not see a pattern. However, past experiences had taught me not to bang the metaphorical table or tear pages in frustration, but to try again. And so I did until my eyelids failed me. The next day I dug out an old geometry book and found the proof.I had some basic sense of Trigonometry but was not fully aware of its potential. Seeing the author harness its power jolted me. I remember having proved the same theorem twice that day. During this period, I had also developed an interest in Physics and discovered Walter Lewin's Physics Lectures. I was once again overawed when I saw the integral symbol cropping up in equations. The more I encountered it, the more I was intrigued by it.So, I taught myself calculus. Once I mastered the basics I went back to that physics lecture. Soon, I was able to understand the mathematics that was involved in our daily lives. Slowly everything was becoming clearer, the derivation of the area of a circle or finding tangents to a curve. For the first time, I felt powerful, not physically but mentally."
"Why are people dishonest? Why do we fail to exercise even though we know it's beneficial for our health? Why are we instantly drawn to purchase free products? In search of answers to these questions, this summer I turned to reading books on Behavioral Economics. As I learned more, I realized that an important challenge facing our generation is to develop a theoretical framework for behavioral economics. This is indeed important because despite being aware of human irrationality, the rational economic theory continues to exert an influence on the way our current economic policies are formulated. And therefore, policies made on critical issues such as health and global warming are bound to be inefficient simply because they fail to acknowledge our quirky, irrational self. I thus believe that developing a deep understanding of Behavioral Economics is a matter of great importance and must be addressed by our generation."
"I think that what truly drives me to learn mathematics, economics or physics for that matter, is to gain the ability to solve my own problems. Being somewhat practical, I often take pleasure in applying my knowledge to investigate the world around me and I've realized that more often than not, the easiest questions to ask are the ones that have the most difficult and nontrivial answers. Moreover, during my early years at high school, I observed that the lack of requisite knowledge in a particular area not only made the task of solving self-devised problems exceedingly difficult but it also deterred me from framing them in the first place. And so from my experience, I am convinced that acquiring knowledge of these disciplines, to a certain extent, will allow me to understand the world and this belief motivates me to educate myself with ever more vigor and passion."
"I looked to the right; crowds of parents and family members were shuffling in the auditorium to find their seatings. Peeking past the main doors, I saw the graduates lining up in the corner lobby, preparing to walk one of the most momentous ceremonies of their lives. My parents and I were straining our necks trying to find my sister amongst them. It was hard to spot her out of the sea of identical caps and gowns, but when she finally stepped onto that stage with her baggy big cap, I started to go nuts with camera shots while my parents screamed her name. This was my first time playing with a camera. It was also the first time I was entrusted with the camera in an official family function, and I must admit touching the camera gave me a positive vibe. I felt great, better than expected. I enjoyed its weight in my hands and the sense of obligation it entailed. The following semester in my sophomore year, my curiosity for the camera prompted me to choose the yearbook class. This was a turning point of my life, when I discovered and consolidated my interest in photography. The yearbook class gave me an insight on the fundamentals of photography. The classworks were more than just assignments for me, they were developing into my hobby, and my talent gradually earned me the reputation as the best photographer in school. In 2015, when my MUN director was looking for the head of press, she thought of me because of my photography skills. When my teacher announced me as the press head for 2015 Southern Taiwan Model United Nations, I knew this was to be a position of responsibility. My immediate issue was the differing levels of camera skills between the members of my MUN team. Since we were pressed for time and all of us had other respective MUN tasks, it was simply inefficient to give them lessons individually. As a result, I wrote a photography guide to help them study during their own convenience. I dug up my camera manual and used it as reference to design the photography guide. I started by translating all the terminology words into simple descriptions for easier understanding, and utilized photoshop to draw out a DSLR diagram so my teammates could check all the relevant functions at a glance. Once the guide was completed and distributed, I only had to host three Q&A sessions to bring the entire team up to acceptable standard. The guide actually helped to save some time, so we had extra time to prepare for our MUN presentations. Consequently, aside from being the head of press for the MUN team, I was also part of the board of activity coordinators. Our duty was to plan out all the events that would occur in those two days. We were calling multiple vendors to negotiate the price and timing of deliveries and setups. During the actual conference, some members were visibly panicking due to the scale of event, but I was able to calm them down through periodic chats with the walkie-talkie and occasional visits into their assigned committees. By the end of the conference, I was amazed by how much my self-confidence had developed. From the experience, I learned to stay strong, because if the leader is not even confident in a task, the rest of the team will easily fall apart. I also learned to be observant, not just for organizing, but for paying heed to the emotional states of my team. Sometimes, a little encouragement at the right moment can be amazing for morale. Most importantly, I also learned responsibility. Being put in a leadership role meant you have to be both emotionally and physically prepared. Thanks to the STMUN and photography, I was able to transit from a clueless student into a responsible adult."
"As an amateur photographer I am naturally curious of everything within my line of sight. Curiosity is what motivates me to learn. This was also how it brought me interested in photography. Unlike Camera has depth, with each button representing its own meaning. Each mode of a camera is an unique perspective of looking at the world. Understanding the camera conceptually and applying it are different matters, by finally mastering the camera, I feel like I have seen many perspectives of life."
"College experience is more than just meeting the professors and students for me. For me personally, I am especially excited about studying abroad. By doing so, it means expanding my horizon from the limited scope of an island country to the open skyline of a global community. Socially, I am looking forward to explore different cultures and meeting the inquisitive minds from different countries. Academically, I am looking forward for growth from learning advanced knowledge of the professors. Most importantly, the resources and opportunities that will become available as a full-fledged Emory Eagle. I plan to make the most of my college experience through the acquisition of new friends, new skills, and new experience in order to become a better business man."
"By day I was an innovator, by night I was a strategist. By daybreak I was creating algorithms and flowcharts, by twilight I was constructing ""value chains"". Every day, I spent countless hours at the desk sitting in front of the incandescent screen, jotting down notes and diagrams. My quaint little room doubled as an office cubicle and as a research facility. I was consumed by my own world where work brought me the ultimate joy. Day-in and Day-out of my gap year, I slogged on my two most adored areas: Business and Medicine. The gap year reignited my fervour for these two fields and it became very evident. A lot of people were critical and dubious of my interests in two entirely distinctive areas, but I followed my heart and bared my soul to my passions. I worked at Cocolevio and created DASHA. Fathoming the complexities of Enterprise software technology and researching at hospital labs to deduce the calculations for Hypoglycaemic index, my gap year was where I ventured in to the unknowns. Every day, having nightly meetings and putting efforts to construct and create cloud storage solutions for CPA's, the internship at Cocolevio pushed my limits to the extent of studying 2 to 3 volumes of my dad's Web services and SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) books. Working at an office placed across seven seas, and at the same time, creating my own Tele medical device proved to be a challenging task, but with every moment being so thought provoking and dynamic, I never realised how my gap year flew. Dealing with business tools that have just emerged into light such as Wardley maps & Value chains, and simultaneously contemplating on new diagnostic sensors for my medical wristband made me strive to find my own answers, and exploration was one that became very predominant throughout. Affiliating with executives of Amazon through conferences and meetings, I comprehended the S3 storage services to integrate it in the development of the cloud based management system. Each time, the enormity of the task was challenging, however, I multitasked and used my abilities and resources at my disposal to its fullest extent. But my job was not confined to this. I had to unravel the unfamiliar terrains of technology and assimilate the information on SaaS Solutions from various sources to decipher complex concepts such as Meta data functions & Composite applications with Business rules, and I encapsulated the knowledge in the form of white papers. Concurrently, making weekly runs to the medical labs and stabbing pages with idea after idea, I transformed my visions to reality through algorithms, flowcharts & diagrams, finding new technology and embodying them into 'One portable device', DASHA. Every piece of intelligence I gained during my medical internships was parallely fostered into DASHA. I designed an IOT device with search & pattern based algorithms to monitor and analyse the vitals of the human body. My concept was like none other ever heard of, and it inspired me to patent the technology. Incidentally, in the course, I realized that I have honed the skills of technology and applied it in the pursuit of my interests, thus making my gap year a hive of activity that helped me in advancing in my business internship and my invention. Managing Business, Technology and Medicine at a time was undoubtedly not easy, but I mastered the ways of carrying it with ease due to my immense passion I share for them. My ambitions and enterprising spirit showed my qualifiedness to directly report to the CEO & CTO of Cocolevio, and brought out my inventiveness to give rise to DASHA. Now I am looking forward to continuing my journey at College to chase my dream of revolutionising the Healthcare industry by becoming a Clinical Entrepreneur."
"""I never go back on my word. That's my ninja way"" The phrase I have lived by since 2006. I'm aware that the Ninja's way of life doesn't apply to me, but their principles on commitment, whether it be towards work or friends/family is one that I cherish. The phrase above was said by the one and only Naruto Uzumaki. It's seldom anybody considers a role model from an Anime (Naruto), but this character is extraordinary.; A boy who is orphaned and isolated, struggles everyday and endures hardships just to get acknowledged and accepted by everyone. His undeterred perseverance and unyielding attitude makes Naruto unique. And I draw parallels with Naruto's personality. I was ridiculed for pursuing interests in Medicine & Business without realizing that I'm a multipotentialite. I was discouraged asking to focus on one particular area, but I'm determined and committed to an unrelenting pursuit of my goals."
"Researching alongside peers at the Woodruff Health Sciences Centre, under the mentorship of professors, and giving life to my medical patent, DASHA, through the SIRE program, I can't wait to set foot on campus at Emory. To be able to receive an environment that acts as a realm for innovation for healthcare is a rare opportunity. I look towards Emory to augment my knowledge and skills in the fields of Medicine and Business by pursuing a double-major in Biology and Business from the Goizueta Business School. Under the BBA-program, I will engage in the Health-Innovation concentration to gain a comprehensive view of 'Device-innovation' within the medical-industry. By taking classes like 'BUS-452 Healthcare Operations & Technology Management' and 'HLTH-407 Modern Health-Challenges: Business and Health Innovation', I will be able to comprehend the nuances of running a business within the medical-field, which will help me chase my dream of becoming a Clinical-Entrepreneur."
"What breaks families apart? Many different reasons might cross your mind. Empty relationships, stress, intolerance, defiance, negligence, greed, abuse. But what separated my family is an issue in a league of its own. Sometime in 2005: -""You went to the riverbank when I warned you not to? In this rain?"" -""Yes, but Abbu, I-"" -""Enough of your heroics. When we find a new home, you're grounded. Get your mother and pack up."" -""Okay, okay! But we're coming back for Eid, right?"" -""There won't be anything to come back to."" Father grew distant. I composed myself. -""Isn't there anything we can do?"" He looked straight out the window towards my grandparents' graves, tears in his eyes. I had my answer. The rain had stopped when I returned, and I saw men in white huddled around the graves by the pond. Father was visiting his parents one last time with my uncles before we left. None of them would be here in two months. My uncles, who decided to stay with their parents as long as possible, would later part ways. Our family would be scattered across the country, starting our lives anew. My grandparents, well, they'd go wherever the river took them. A faint rattle alerted us. Sounded like gunfire, but we knew what it really was. We'd woken up to it countless times at night, afraid. We'd witnessed what caused it. It came from the river Madhumati as it devoured its bank, intent on doing the same to our home. It was climate change that drove us apart. Bakshipur - the village we lived in - was a ""char"", one of many alluvium islands in the rivers of Bangladesh. The fertile land attracted settlers from near and far. But fueled by melted Himalayan ice, the Madhumati soon began eroding it. Grandfather, as the village senior, repeatedly pleaded with authorities and NGOs to dump cement bags along the riverbank to protect it. Trees planted along there tried to hold the soil together and buy us time; they fell eventually, but help never came. The stronger the water current grew, the more people lost: crops, cattle, livelihoods, schools, houses, hope, happiness, the lives of the distraught. Triggered by global warming, the river snatched away everything we all had like a ruthless deity. Such erosions plague all riverside communities. While the fortunate manage to escape the ordeal, the helpless learn to make peace with it, accepting this routine destruction as an inevitable misery. They drift away on boats till they find a strip of land to call home. They farm and fish to ensure they at least have a lump of cooked rice to half-fill their stomachs, and yarn to sew old lungis and sharis together to make one blanket that barely holds off the cold. Living like refugees in their own country, that's the best life they can build for themselves till the river pops their bubble. Then they start over. Despite there being living proof that climate change is real and catastrophic, many people at home and abroad remain woefully oblivious. Naturally, people care most when their dearest ones suffer before their eyes. Few would cry their hearts out in ink or on social media for climate change victims miles away. Many don't believe they're in a position to help. To protect their interests, others don't even admit it's real and thwart efforts to mitigate it. Living in Bangladesh, the ""ground zero"" of climate change, it gnaws at my conscience when people suffer for things beyond their control while those in control look away. Captain Planet isn't real, but we are. Big changes happen in small steps, and the power to make them happen is ours. Through my organization, Renovearth Bangladesh, I'm bringing the fortunate in touch with the plight of the unfortunate, helping them be environmentally responsible, and creating low-cost, easy-to-use green technology to build better lives for everyone."
"My search for books on critical thinking led me to Carl Sagan's ""The Demon-Haunted World"" . I'm fascinated each time I read it. The book lays bare the dynamics behind people's beliefs, and persuades people to find truth backed by insurmountable evidence. Sagan's avid support of critical thinking shines throughout it. He shows readers why they shouldn't take things at face value, but always delve deeper. He acknowledges the courage it takes to reinvent oneself, but opines that it's better to grasp reality than to live inside a comfortable illusion. In these trying times, we need that objectivity and vigilance. If time machines existed, I would give young Hitler this book after he felt deceived by Jews and Social Democrats, so he would choose informed decisions over impassioned ones. Readers will feel compelled to do some soul-searching, to re-evaluate assumptions old and new. I strongly recommend everyone to read it."
"""You know what? Learning is pointless."" I chuckled. ""Really?"" ""Really. Look at Bill Gates. Or Mark Zuckerberg. They dropped out of Harvard. Now they have enough money to live like kings."" I chuckled again. ""They made it to Harvard, didn't they?"" ""Yes, but-"" ""And how do you know their learning never helped them?"" ""Okay. Why do you learn?"" ""Because I'm curious. Because I get to delve deep into subjects to unearth secrets. The more I know, the more I realize how less I actually know. It humbles me. I realize how I'm connected to everything, and I'm motivated to serve the common good. Each question becomes a puzzle for me; a correct answer becomes an achievement, a wrong one a chance to grow. As a person, I'm enlightened; professionally, I'm armed with knowledge and insight into numerous opportunities."" ""That's...deep."" ""Learn for your mind, not just your pockets. You'll know."""
"Bushy, untamed beard. Tired, blue eyes. Tan, wrinkled face. The man appeared to be homeless. Towering above him was a police officer in a navy uniform with a blue ""Baltimore Police"" patch on her left sleeve, ordering him to move. But the man sat still, almost meditatively, with his face stone-cold, unyielding to her words. As we drove past the homeless man and police officer while visiting my uncle last Winter break, my father said, ""Finally, someone is telling the homeless man to move. What he's doing-loitering-is illegal. Whatever he did, he got himself homeless. He's not normal. If he were normal, he would go to a homeless shelter, get a job, and change his circumstances."" I was shocked. If Social Darwinism is an outdated concept, then why are the homeless perceived so negatively? In school, we had learned about the Social Darwinist theory-the belief that people are subject to natural selection just like plants and animals. I learned that the popular 19th century theory contributed to the poor being perceived negatively, as though their poverty was their fault. However, these abstract ideas never extended beyond the classroom until I heard my father's reaction to the homeless man in Maryland. This startling interaction made me realize that such attitudes are alive and well. Anecdotally, there are many who believe that homeless individuals are criminals, involved with rape, violence, robbery, alcoholism, and drugs. I, however, was not satisfied with this perception, so I challenged my father. Each time we passed a person who appeared to be homeless as we drove through the cities along the Eastern seaboard, we began a new argument-a duel over morality. I began with the obvious; Social Darwinism is a theory that discriminates against one group and claims one's superiority over another. But, with a flick of his hand, my father dismissed my comments, in denial of his discriminatory views and unaware that the only thing separating him from a similar circumstance is a few unfortunate twists of fate. Next, I layered my argument with facts, studies, and quotes that I had researched. Studies from the Coalition for the Homeless have shown that homelessness is primarily caused by factors out of the individual's control-domestic violence, job loss, eviction, lack of affordable housing. Most importantly, studies have shown that homeless shelters are unsafe and overpopulated-often crime-ridden with rape, robbery, and drug abuse. I spit out numbers: there are 1.56 million homeless people nationwide-that's too many people to fit in the shelters. These statistics were not enough to sway my father, even as we passed a shivering homeless woman in Philadelphia, wrapped only in a thin blanket. The fourth time we discussed the topic, I was prepared with more facts and figures to dish out. I had memorized more statistics and names of different organizations. I was ready to state my thesis, list all of the reasons why homeless people are on the street, and conclude with a definitive statement. That day, we saw a woman sleeping upright on a crate in Boston. Her head, a disarray of curly brown hair, was leaning back against the brick wall. She wore a flimsy, tattered coat that exposed her bulging stomach. Beside her was a cardboard sign that read: PREGNANT. NEED $ TO GO HOME. I forgot about the studies and percentages I had memorized. I thought to myself: she has a family. She has a baby. She is human. Before I could say anything, my father dropped some money in her cup. I was stunned. Then I smiled. Through my zeal to convince my father of the homeless' plight, I was so focused on facts and figures that I forgot the central point. My search for studies and numbers obscured the fundamental argument for helping the homeless: compassion."
"Gazania longiscapa. The African daisy. An unusual, brightly-colored flower which blossoms during the day and closes at night to protect itself. This is what I'd like my college to resemble. I look for an academically acclaimed university, like Emory, which opens its doors to embrace students from all over the world and walks of life, yet provides a nurturing, safe environment where students can stretch and grow intellectually and personally. Like the colorful petals, I aspire to go somewhere vibrant and diverse, to meet others with backgrounds different from my own. With a curious mind, passion for helping others, and having grown up in a Vietnamese Buddhist household, I will bring a unique perspective to Emory, a place with multicultural emphasis-how many colleges accept undocumented students and have 100+ study abroad programs? With Emory's warm embrace, I will feel right at home. After all, my favorite drink is Coke."
"""I want to thank you for sponsoring me because I got to read,"" wrote Aliza. Aliza is in 8th grade, lives with her parents in Nepal, and will be the first in her family to attend college. Aliza is one of the scholars sponsored by our She's the First club which I co-founded and co-lead. Our club raised enough money last year to pay for her schooling. Recently, I started to lose motivation to work hard in school. It was no longer easy for me to stay up late and solve that last integral problem. Senioritis has struck! But reading Aliza's letter brought me back to the reality and privilege of being a student here... that I have the opportunity to learn and grow... that I can explore and expand my horizons... her words inspired me to refocus, work harder, and prepare for the more challenging classes in college."
"Some people find their worth is defined by their accomplishment; others have it wrapped up in a sense of joy or happiness. I seem to have it a bit harder, as my worth is combined and subtracted, flipped upside down, shaken and well-stirred and then baked under a pressure that no mere rock could possibly withstand until finally, all that is left is my voice. My performance. My life. My mother claimed that there were two extraordinary attributes that stood out above anything else. One was my dimple and the second, my voice. I chose to focus on the second, although I'm sure my mother wished I wouldn't have, as often as she has had to bust down my door to get me to stop singing at the top of my lungs in the middle of the night (and still does). Who else would ignore such a clear sign from God about what path I should follow? However, my mother has been and continues to be exceptionally supportive of my interest in the arts. On her side of the family, all of my relatives were talented in some way artistically, whether it was singing, acting, or dancing. And of course, there was always some form of music lingering throughout family gatherings. I soon yearned to make my own way onto the stage rather quickly by joining the worship team at my church. Though only a child at the time, my worship leaders were quite impressed at the maturity level and the amount of control I had of my voice when they first heard me. Over the years, I have worked my way up through practice, dedication and voice lessons to earn myself numerous solos and leads. This recognition has allowed me to network and meet many interesting and talented people, as well as receive several recommendations to various schools, one of whom recommended that I attend a fine arts school to enhance my chosen craft. Growing up, I have attended several fine arts schools where I have found myself immersed in the artistic culture of my surroundings. To further embrace this culture, I have enrolled in core classes that are involved in theory, vocal music, acting, and dance. Having a peer network that has a similar passion for the fine arts as myself, has assisted my growth and development to truly appreciate the opportunity to amplify my gift and pushing me to strive to be the best I can be. From the time of my birth, my voice has been an important part of my life, by taking courses in music every day and never growing tired of the constant dedication and practice, helped me realize that no matter what path I chose in life, music would somehow always be incorporated into it. And today, it is my life."
"Many would say that our greatest challenge as a generation is our laziness, our selfishness, or our reliance on technology. However, I believe that it is instead our willingness to turn back instead of forge ahead, that is a detrimental handicap to myself and my peers. With slogans such as ""Make America Great Again"", gaining ever more popularity, especially after the recent election, we risk losing our courage and inventiveness when we take our eyes off the future and all of its possibilities and instead focus on the past. What once was can never be again, but the future is not set in stone. I believe that my generation does have its flaws, but we are also brave, open-minded, accepting, encouraging, and so much more. It is time to use those qualities and be the writers of a new chapter in the book of life."
"It has been said that education is the great equalizer. For this reason, my thirst for knowledge is unmatched, unsurpassed, and unquenched. In the classroom, your background and circumstances have no bearing on your future success. A willingness to put aside previous ideals and open your mind is all that is asked of you. Growing up with a mother who was the first person in our family to graduate from college, I have seen firsthand how life-changing getting an education can be, and how it enables you to follow your dreams. This is what motivates me. Knowing that with every life lesson, every class, and every interaction puts me one step closer to reaching my goals."
"Try-State ""I don't know how you do it, I could never do that. Don't you ever get tired? How do you do so well in school? Do you have friends?"" It was 6 am as I reflected on the questions I heard that weekend after I told church members that I run track, take all honors/AP classes at my high school in New Jersey, participate in a weekly Saturday scholars program in New York City, while faithfully attending church in Connecticut, where my father is the Pastor. And no, the title of my essay is not a typo. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, known as the Tri-state area has also been my ""Try-state"" area, the backdrop of my coming of age. Since ninth grade every weekend, and some weeknights, I have traversed between these three states. I've learned a lot about my family, my communities, and who I have become as a person through this four year journey. Although the three states are not that far from one another geographically, each community that I travel to is worlds apart and has challenged me to adjust to each environment accordingly without sacrificing my core identity. I have been challenged to find ways to maintain my grades, excel in track, and continue to stay involved in each aspect of my life. At first I questioned whether I was capable of successfully transitioning to high school, maintaining a social life, all while getting adjusted to a new church in Connecticut and still participating in multiple activities. My father had become the Pastor of a church Connecticut just as I was beginning high school. I thought this transition was going to affect me negatively, but my parents allowed me to stay in New Jersey to finish high school with my friends. Still, there were going to be so many new changes: going from middle school to high school, entering new social circles, higher levels of academic expectations in school and extracurricular programs, as well as the demands of varsity track. Change scared me and I didn't know how to face it. What frightened me the most was the thought of not knowing who I genuinely was. I felt like I was becoming a chameleon, constantly changing based on the environment I found myself in, rather than a constant version of myself. In order to combat this fear, I relaxed and evaluated my situation. Yes, I was going to be on the road, but that would give me time to work on homework in the car. In addition to strengthening my work ethic, I would maintain my social life by utilizing social media and FaceTime to communicate with friends. I soon realized that I was capable of being on top of my school work, prioritizing my obligations, better managing my time, and finding alternative solutions to interacting with friends in each community. My experience has taught me to assess challenging situations, put them into perspective, and develop a strategy for overcoming circumstances that initially appear as obstacles. Challenges are actually opportunities dressed up in adversity. Although math has often stretched me, I have embraced the concept of a variable versus a constant and applied it to my life. A variable is a symbol with a value not yet known, whereas a constant is an absolute value, never changing. One is not better than the other, but together they form a function contingent upon their inclusion, just like a chameleon! Over these past four years I have developed invaluable skills that will serve me well in college and in my business career. Adaptability, innovation, creativity, strategy, tenacity, relationship-building, and a strong work ethic, are tools that I have honed. So as I now reflect on the questions that were asked of me, that previously undermined my confidence, they are now ""ebenezers,"" reminding me of how far I have come and what I have overcome."
"Attending the ideal university would afford me the opportunity to explore my academic interests, make life-long relationships, and prepare me for my career. In this setting I would be stretched through challenging work to further develop my current capabilities to their fullest potential while discovering new ones.The curriculum would allow me to pursue both of my passions for developing strategic marketing initiatives for sustainable organizational success and leading with a social awareness of people, communities, and society. It would also prepare me for service opportunities on campus and the community during my time there. Participation in business case competitions, are invaluable for lessons of teamwork, diversity of thought, and leadership. Proximity to culturally diverse communities, an engaged and social student body and nearby corporations to intern with are important as well. An environment where extensive resources, faculty and staff are available for an interdisciplinary, hands-on learning experience are essential. "
"""Sydney is a great student, she just has to learn to manage how social she is."" At a young age I was told to ""manage"" my social tendencies. Most teachers saw my ability to communicate as a distraction. Ever since I can remember, I have always been inquisitive, eager to learn why things were the way they were. As I have matured, I have learned to better manage my gregariousness into productive, intellectual dialogue inside and outside of classroom settings. My ability to effectively communicate enables me to learn from others with the intent of meeting a need, solving a problem or addressing an issue. Continuous learning is intrinsic to my character. I naturally interact with all groups of people which gives me different perspectives to consider as I learn. Engaging in passionate dialogue around relevant issues, while evaluating historical events in modern contexts is what I enjoy the most."
"There was a wooden box in our house that preceded me and all of my siblings. The things inside were also as old as its rusty key holes suggested. Despites its looks, however, it was one in which I once discovered treasures from my parents past - letters, diaries and pictures from their younger days. The story it told of my parents was more fresh, amusing and engaging than any I had heard from themselves. However, the box has another story to tell. That story was its own - one hidden inside its thick wooden blocks and stitched together by its corroded nails. For me that story is more profound than the one that sat inside it for many years. For the story of that box is my story too. When I met this box, it was a mere furniture in our living room. It made a comfortable low seat. Since my parents had forgotten what lied inside and the rest of us did not care, at least in our mind, the inside of it was as hollow as the inside of any of the other couches in the living room. In fact, it was no more thought of as a box, that it got improved over the years to make a better seating. A cushion was added on top. Its colors were changed a few times to match the rest of the living room. Its key hole was almost made invisible. At some point, we even started referring to it as the Dukka, an Ethiopian name for a low seat. But its service as a chair had to come to an end as some point. One day, as I arrived at home from school, I saw items piled outside the house that were going to be dumped. As I was going through them to see if any of them could be useful, I came across the Dukka (sorry, I meant the box). Since the room I shared with my brother was mostly empty and unfurnished, I decided to salvage it - to extend its life as a chair. But as I set it down, I felt a hole with one of my fingers. I looked closer and saw the hole can take a key. I felt a wave of excitement as the it started unmasking its self. After much effort, I managed to get it open with the help of my brother. A new chapter started in the box's life (no more a Dukka, I guess). The treasures that were unearthed were much invaluable. Every one of them were regarded priceless ended up sharing a cabinet among the most important family documents. The story of the wooden box is my story too. Like the box, there were two distinct chapter in my life too. If anyone dared to speak about me, he had to refer to two different Gedeons belonging to two different eras of my life. Until half-way through my teenage years, I did not take interest in myself let alone others. But once a light turned on inside leading me to see myself as never before, I discovered the treasure that I was ignorant of all my life. The labels that I and others agreed to that masked the ""true me"" started coming off one by one. As I unlocked myself after much effort, I felt I was valuable for the first time. That did not make me hold back. I have been giving freely all I had until this point. You might wonder what came of the wooden box in the end. I really do not know. But I do know it went off empty - did not decay with its treasures. And I choose to do the same."
"When a world stops benefiting from the goods of youths, then we can say that the world is facing a great challenge. The level of standard (the maximum capacity of contribution that youth can perform to the world) has been decreasing nowadays. Being influenced by the popular culture, our generation has become victim of those celebrities of the time. It has enforced the youth to abusively understand the concepts of life. Being obsessed by the lifestyles reflected by the celebrities, the youth is getting far from shouldering responsibility about himself and his community as well. In other words, the youth is in the verge of identity crisis. Since, the future of the world is upon the hands of the youth, the youth must have to be substantial. Yet, if they lose their entire personality, the world will certainly suffer from the irresponsible oppressors of the youth."
"When somebody does something useful for its community, we call him/her relevant. Relevancy is being valuable and significant. But, little are able to grasp the path. Because, it requires people's commitment to be called so. One has to discover who really he/she is to become relevant in a community. He/she must attain it working hard once after identify self. However, if he/she is not focused on what is inside, he/she will definitely become mundane. Education is one of the greatest weapons that dig out what is inside a man. It also maximizes the potential after it has been discovered. As a man who is granted a great potential, I want to benefit my community with all what I have already received. I want to be buried empty when I die. I thoroughly want to be the most accessed treasure on earth. This motivates me to engage myself to learning willingly."
"Many known success stories may have gotten their start in the same way I did. ""On a whim"" is the phrase I would use to describe the entry into my unexpected success. My family and I had just left our familiar surroundings in Virginia to embark on a fresh start in a new state. While traveling, I was laughing and talking with my older brother about the changes regarding school, friends, and our new neighborhood in Georgia. My mother described it as ""an exciting adventure."" Of course, she said those words to get me in the car, none of us having any idea how true those words would become. To fill my summer, my mother enrolled me in an all-day summer camp with a variety of activities. Unknowingly, that camp was headed by a judo-jujitsu instructor. With judo as part of the day's activities, the camp leader, who later became my sensei, saw in me a natural talent that he wanted to cultivate. I found it exciting to discover the control that I could train my body to produce in physical and mental situations. So began my love and accomplishments in the martial art of judo. I jumped in. I have no regrets. I have never looked back. At the age of nine, I entered into my first judo tournament experiencing many emotions as I stood in opposition against my first competitor. As most of my opponents would be, he was much taller than me. However, in judo a person's height is not always a guaranteed advantage. I lost my first match, but just like Rocky I said to myself, ""I'm not going down anymore."" Competing in two divisions, I went on to finish that tournament without losing another match. That was the beginning of what I knew would be my choice of sport. I continued my hard work and in 2012 I became the #1 junior judo champion in the male 48 kilos category for all of the United States! Judo is a predominantly male sport known for its objective to throw or take down an opponent with an immobilizing pin, or the forceful use into submission through the use of a joint lock or choke. Ironically, even though it is the most combative sport in the world, judo has helped strengthen the principle of gentleness in me from the practice mats to my life with family, friends, and even strangers. While the intense almost unforgiving feeling of punishment during training yields strength, flexibility, agility, speed, power, and endurance, it also surprisingly builds social skills with long lasting meaningful relationships. Stressing camaraderie and bonding, my competitions have given me the opportunity to forge friendships and meet people from all over the world. In December of 2012, I represented the United States in Harnes, France. I remember navigating my way through the snow and unfamiliar but charming streets of France with the guidance of strangers. During this tournament, I met competitors that I still greet at other competitions. In every match, I step onto the mat with the intent to annihilate my opponent; however, because of the shared love of the sport, and because we have trained through physically difficult and mentally demanding drills to become the best, respect is earned and acknowledged by both. Judo has also opened my eyes to the Asian culture. Learning to count and master the techniques of judo in Japanese began as a fun game in the dojo with my peers. However, it has now developed into a deep desire to immerse myself as much as possible into other cultures. After visiting Shanghai and Beijing, I am strongly considering a permanent move abroad. This has intensified my drive to speak, write, and read both Japanese and Chinese. The love for these languages goes beyond my studies in school. The connection is felt from my passion of judo to my future living abroad."
"Most people attend college to ensure they will be offered a good paying job to support themselves. With employment, comes the mandatory contribution of the social security tax. It was not intended to be the only source of income upon retirement, however dependency and expectancy of this benefit has discouraged private savings. The promises of this benefit are in serious danger of being affected as life expectancy has increased and fertility rates are down. Due to many factors, people are simply living longer. This naturally creates an important challenge in the next fifty years for those who do not financially plan well."
"The college experience naturally includes the distancing of a parent's protective shadow. It can certainly be unnerving, but exciting at the same time. I look forward to being more independent and making good choices on my own. College is going to bring me one step closer to achieving my business goals and desires. This accomplishment alone elates me. I also look forward to meeting other students who share a more common connection of my specific aspirations."
"History History has always been one of my favorite subjects because I have had some super teachers. Whether it was Mr. Bruning's hands on learning, Mr. Hickey's charm and simplistic approach to understanding, or Ms. W.P's way of throwing her shoe at the map on the wall to explain what location of history we would be diving into next; history was a logical passion for me. The one underlying theme that has always stuck out to me, no matter what teacher I had, and is that history repeats itself; if I don't learn from past mistakes of other people and myself, I am destined to make the same mistakes again. One failure that comes to mind occurred during my sophomore tennis season. My freshman year, I was number seven on the team and played varsity doubles. Of course, I knew that I would continue on with my varsity play my sophomore year. Everybody said that I had the spot, so I grew overconfident in myself and didn't practice nearly as hard as I should have during the offseason. Losing six of my team challenge matches and missing some practice time, I had a rough start. By just bad luck and how the other challenge matches went, I was placed at number fourteen in the line-up. That sophomore year, I went from varsity to not even considered JV. I was extremely angry when I saw the new standing in the line-up. l only saw that there were people that I beat ahead of me and that there was absolutely no way that I could make varsity that year. I blamed my coach for putting me there when the only person I should have been blaming was myself. I told everyone that I was fine with it and that this season was going to be an easy year, and it was. The first half of the year was as expected, playing people way below my skill level. But after winning, there was never the satisfaction of a victory over a challenging opponent. I missed the thrill of adrenaline rushing, my heart beating so fast because each stroke could cost me the match. Halfway through the season, I knew I needed to overcome the rut I was in so I could enjoy the sport that I loved. By the end of the season, I climbed from fourteenth on the team to eighth, almost making it to varsity. The players for sectionals and the last tournament of the year were already chosen, and I was not one of them. Although it was a bitter season of frustration and discontent, I learned from my mistakes and set out to make sure my failure would not repeat itself. And it did not. During the pre-season leading up to my junior year, I worked hard, practicing almost every day during the summer to improve my skills, going to the girl's team practices whenever I could, and joining a league where I played tennis every Saturday during the winter. All the hard work paid off when the season arrived. I finished 3rd place in the Rock Island Invite and 2nd Place in our own invite. Coaches on opposing teams praised my partner's and my doubles-play. The UTHS coach even said that we were the best number 3 doubles team that he has ever seen. If I had continued to put myself down or not pushed myself to do my absolute best, I would have never done as well as I did this past season. I learned success is not measured by what other people say. It all depends on how much hard work I put into it. I'm going to fail and keep failing for the rest of my life, but as long as I learn from these failures, my history will not repeat itself. I will only continue to improve my path for the future."
"One of the greatest challenges that we face now, and will continue to face in the next 50 years, is the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The chance that a pathogen which can withstand any drug is a threat to us today. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are forming faster than we can produce a cure. This is because patients demand a quick fix for their ailments, even if the antibiotic isn't the medication they need. This means that bacteria are exposed to antibiotics not meant for them, allowing the bacteria to mutate and create a new strain of antibiotic resistant bacteria. While we continue to produce antibiotics to combat these new strains, there are only so many combinations of drugs left. As someone who wants to enter the medical field, this is a problem that I will face everyday and a challenge that will affect my generation for years to come."
"If I could give credit to a single book for igniting my love for reading, it would be Chicka Chicka Boom Boom by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault. I remember during my childhood, waking up every morning and having my mom read Chicka Chicka Boom Boom to me. The vibrant colors, rhythmic pattern, and amusing pictures kept me entertained for many months. As a kid, I could also relate to the little letters as they got in trouble and still make the same foolish mistakes. Through this simple nursery rhyme book, I started to fall in love with reading. As the nursery rhyme turned into chapter books, and these chapter books turned into nonfiction and classic literature, I can still trace back to where my reading started... all the way to the orange polka dot framed Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book."
"I uneasily shifted my gaze from the plump lizard planted on the bathroom window sill and looked down at my grandmother's toilet to count six cockroaches symmetrically lining the inside of the seat. I trembled, observing how their black shells seemed to shimmer menacingly in the sweltering tropical summer. Their polish was a stark contrast to the dull brown of the dirt-ridden toilet bowl. Clenching my teeth, I stepped forward to further examine the complexities of my task ahead. I could now identify each filiform antennae, mesothorax, and metathorax. I laughed at the unexpected application of my high school biology class. Yes, just like biology class, I thought, taking comfort in the clinical objectivity of science. Buoyed by this logic, I grabbed a broom from the corner and carefully used the end to prod my bathroom buddies into excusing themselves. But after a few failed attempts, I set aside the broom, amazed at the roaches' unyielding insolence. I continued to ignore the lizard, fat and grotesque on its perch, who was clearly enjoying the show. As I heard the squishing sound of my flip flops against the perpetually wet bathroom floor, I shivered with the feeling of 1,000 lizards running up my back. Swallowing my neat freak instincts, I quickly proceeded to complete my most dreaded task whenever I visited India. While I experienced this trauma quite frequently, I never spoke of my reptilian bathroom audience or my acquaintances from the underworld with anyone. My fear of being made an outsider, unable to adjust to a different environment, fueled my silence. As a young grandchild visiting India once every two years, I was accustomed to enduring the well-intentioned teasing of my family members. I scornfully embraced their grating nickname for me, ""America girl."" Each time I forgot to take blessings from elders, each time I accepted a gift with my left hand instead of my right, each time I made a mistake in speaking my native language (that is, constantly), I was playfully mocked - and deeply embarrassed and ashamed. While I dreaded entering the bathroom, the world outside its confined four walls was no cake walk. Just as I examined each cockroach with scientific precision, I was the cockroach outside the bathroom, subject to dissection. From the thickness of my hair (too thin), to my rating on the skin fairness scale (too dark), my every action and word elicited a host of comments and exacting criticisms. With no other retreat, I spent an undesirable amount of time in the judgement-free bathroom. I found strange peace standing painfully erect with wide eyes running in tear-filled circles to ensure no creatures invaded my bubble of self-pity. Each time I set foot into the bathroom, it was a summons for my arthropod adversaries; they seemed to see it as a call bell for a playdate. However, as I wished to sulk in solitude, I attempted to deny their presence. I explored new techniques to catalyze their departure: jabbing, jabbing with water, jabbing with soap water, more jabbing, even jabbing to the beat of ""La Cucaracha."" Nothing worked. I was forced to accept their perpetual companionship in all things hygiene. As aesthetically pleasing as a cockroach's thorny legs are, I never imagined analyzing them in such detail. Yet, I found comfort in the dispassionate task of observation and classification. I overcame my initial discomfort through the strength of rationality - a reliance on unchanging truths. The lesson was powerful: for life on drier floors, too, I could grapple with my non-belonging by adopting a scientific lens. Fact: my hair was thin. Fact: my rating on the skin fairness scale was dismal. Fact: none of these jabs define me."
"The line for Starbucks extends beyond the door, pouring out into the downtown Greensboro street. A veteran in a wheelchair circles the door. Shivering, he mumbles his request for help. Everyone politely ignores him. His eyes are dull, suggesting he too is numb. Greensboro - an authentic bastion of Southern culture - is in many ways a microcosm for how ill-equipped society is to address its jarring economic disparities. In the age of Occupy Wall Street and rising nativist populism, our challenge is increasingly not just about closing wealth gaps - it is about bridging fundamentally different realities. Our task will be to recognize and remedy an awkward truth: we (yes, we) have found ourselves out of touch with those who do not strive to attend reputed educational institutions, who do not obsess over the next tech invention, who do not wait 15 minutes for a $4 chai tea latte."
"While touring and learning about the Emory community, I realized what I missed in the last four years of high school. In a class of only 47 students, where we dispersed after 10th grade to attend courses at Guilford college, I never experienced school spirit and comradery. In my college experience, I am most looking forward to the emphasis on community building to gain lifelong friendships and advocates. Specifically, at Emory, I can find that community pride strengthened by distinctively Oxford traditions. Whether it be jumping away the stress of finals in a bouncy castle on Wonderful Wednesdays, fighting for my residential complex in a heated trivia challenge in the Oxford Olympics, testing my creative abilities in Emory's very own ""American Idol,"" or writing a poem pleading Dooley to dismiss me from class, Emory promises a memorable, communal college experience."
"A blanket of thick white mist shrouded my vision as I struggled to locate a horizon-the horizon, any horizon, from the small window in my crumbling home in Bangladesh. The tin houses in front of me seemed to merge together on this cool, autumn day; as if they were uniformly colored like the ephemeral tendrils of clouds high above in the sky. It was a perfect balance of dichotomies, with the high rises in the distance standing in stark contrast to the dilapidated houses in front of my eyes. As I continued to gaze upon the area where my old home used to stand, my mind wandered to another scene in the past. This time, I saw red and orange flames as they engulfed my old home. For the next six months, I'd live on the streets of Bangladesh with my family. We would be desolate, poor and hopeless. Education would become something far from a priority, and I would instead spend my days helping my older brother to sell fruits on the street. Every possible tragedy seemed to have impacted my family, altering our very lives in unimaginable ways. I still remember the day when two Police officers knocked on our door notifying us that my Uncle had died in a hit and run accident. Tears had begun to run down my cheeks almost instantly. The man had been a role model for me throughout my life, helping me to cope with the harsh realities of the world. Who would be the one to guide me, now that he was gone? We found my Uncle's body in the middle of the street, lying in a pool of his own dried blood. The Police had contacted us many hours after the actual accident because the body was an ""inconvenience"" for traffic and pedestrians. Only later did we find out that an ambulance had arrived after the accident, but promptly left after some bystanders notified the medics that my uncle most likely did not have the money to pay for the treatment. His life could have been saved if only he had received the help at the time. However, in a country like Bangladesh, poverty itself can often prove to be the deadliest sickness This was a sickness that millions around the world are forced to live with since no one is willing to help them attain the same opportunities as others. Some often argue that third world countries lack in efficient delivery of healthcare and that is the primary reason behind the loss of lives in those countries. Even at a young age, I knew that while this very fact is certainly true, the most harm is often caused by the inequity in the health care system itself. So, I often pondered how the situation would've been different for my Uncle if only he had been a few rungs higher on the ladder of social status, and whether he would still be alive today in that case. At the time I was helpless, there was nothing I could do to save his life. The horrible memories from my past will be forever engrained in my mind. Over time, however, I realized that instead of dwelling on my unfortunate past I should turn my attention to the future. My uncle may no longer be able to guide me, but he still serves as a beacon of hope. While I still remember the homelessness, the poverty and the unfortunate deaths of many loved ones, I now know that I can change the future for many. Perhaps it is this very internal drive that allows me to keep moving forward, despite what barrier may come in my path. I will continue to struggle until I can say with confidence that no one would again fall prey to the sickness of poverty."
"I have always wanted to work on improving healthcare policy, especially in underdeveloped countries. As I started reading more and more about politicians in the US debating over health policy issues, I always thought about one thing: who is debating over these issues in other countries? More than often the answer for ""third world"" countries is the same: ""No one."" I began to realize that the largely corrupt health care system, in which wealth reigns supreme, would never change unless someone took the initiative to bring about the change. What enthralls me most about my college experience is being able to integrate my ideas from both my classes that I took throughout my life, concerning inequality, as well as from my personal life into my overall college affair, thus enabling others to observe the world from different perspectives that may not have been as apparent before."
"I have traveled to Dhaka three times so far since immigrating to New York nine years ago. I spent the majority of my time there helping to build shelters with Brighter Builders, a non-profit organization in Dhaka that builds homeless shelters for the poor in Bangladesh. This summer, along with working with Brighter Builders, I simultaneously taught a fifth-grade class made up of students who were/are homeless in Bangladesh. I aspire to learn and to expand my current knowledge concerning inequalities that people in foreign nations encounter daily. I wish to study other foreign policies that may be implemented internationally in order to ameliorate the lives of others, especially of those living in impoverished nations. For me, the giggles and smiles of a destitute child after receiving the opportunity to enter a classroom for the first time are perhaps some of the most gratifying and sights on Earth."
"The issue of inequality regarding the LGBTQ community is the most important problem to me. This problem needs to be solved because it is atrocious the violence towards these innocent people. Every day, I hear of an act of terrorism at a pride parade or police brutality towards an individual for proposing to their significant other. For example, after a police raid of a beauty pageant during pride week in Uganda, one young man jumped out of a fourth story window because he was so terrified for his life. It rips my heart apart to see their fear and helplessness caused my ignorant people who are stuck in their ways. This is an ethical issue that is imperative that we fix. This issue is especially specific to me because I am bisexual and I am afraid of what someone may do to me simply because of who I love. Since I was young, I have always felt a connection to the LGBTQ community that I did not understand at the time. I never knew of the immense sadness and torture they were going through. I have just always found so much interest in the LGBTQ community. To me, they are some of the most interesting and kindest people I have ever met. They have so much respect and love for one another; this is what makes the community so strong. They always support each other in times of need and in times of success. The most major step that could be taken to solve this problem is awareness. Most that discriminate against the LGBTQ community do not understand them or are confused by them. Other steps that could be taken are creating organizations dedicated to helping those affected in the LGBTQ community such as All Out. Organizations such as this help those affected by offering mental and emotional support, as well as raising money to pay for expenses such as medical bills. A step I have taken is I am starting my own t-shirt line to raise awareness and money to aid those in trouble and in fear for their lives."
"My favorite show is RuPaul's Drag Race because I love that the contestants are able to display their talents in a supportive environment. I also love that the viewers are more concerned with seeing the talents and personalities of each new queen that enters the work room. Most importantly to me, I love that the show is not mainstream so it keeps its authenticity."
I am motivated to learn because I want to understand everything about the world around me. I have always been curious and asked questions about everything I came across. I want to use this information to improve the world I live in.
"Very often, I have discovered that life is full of amazing events, overwhelming us with surprises for each distinct meaning. No matter when, wherever I reached, surprises followed me quietly, steadfastly. The past years of encountering them one or multiple at a time have grown me stronger to withstand times of uncertainties and discouragement. So far, I know that disappointment and difficulty from living young adulthood leave indelible marks until I wipe them off with undiminished energy and determination. They might be displeasing, but are worth keeping for the sake of recollection, maturation indeed. Around me were a plenty of evidence that my genes were made to perform. My parents went to Korea's best colleges, and my sister attends an Ivy League school. But I was an exception. I did not stand out through middle school, further causing them to fear that I might drop out. Their perception of me has not yet substantially changed. For where you went to school mattered so much in my culture, being an average kid meant failure to begin with. Or maybe, I was just an anomaly for thinking that I was normal. Often striking my guitar strings and singing to emulate Led Zeppelin, I made it inevitable for many to yell or finger point at me. And when I had a crush on a curly-haired, intriguing girl next door, adamantly refusing tutors yet spending hundreds of hours writing love letters, my parents asked me to leave for America. I never thought I harmed my parents' reputation in this little town of rice field. Before saying good bye, I was already boarded on a plane to New York. My first weekend at my sister's dormitory struck me with the awe of her classmates' devotion to their personal and, therefore, academic pursuits. Pride was palpable, as they sparkled with enthusiasm to learn and discover truths to unanswered questions. But why, and what drives them so hard, was my question hovering overhead. Visiting other colleges and asking students my question, I found something beyond variations amidst their responses: love is pure, and the love for learning pushes them beyond limits. Back in my dorm room, I often contemplated. Mirroring in their confessions of intellectual captivation, I saw myself doing a lot of things I loved doing already; I just needed to push myself a little harder. So I did, without thinking too deeply about how things would turn out. My classroom dynamics turned even more positively and beyond classroom, I found my places anew. Editing school newspaper and launching Digital Journalism Club excited me, for being responsible for communicating broader community in a language other than my own. Clashing ideas frequenting arguments made everyone working together increasingly skilled and confident. And the more I learned about my school, I found campus services. Assisting air-conditioners' maintenance and repairs, I learned how classroom, dormitory, and administrative buildings cohere, making school such an adorable, special place. Supporting engineers build and operate solar-energy generator for school elevated me to greater knowledge and experiences. Introducing technological makings of the rice wine I brought from home turned concerns into my teachers' reception with vehemence and ensuing studies. And very fortunately, my experiential learning skills allowed me to assist university scholars study bio-engineering technologies and the underlying physics. I never knew what I could really expect and achieve. But the community and friends I have fallen in love with helped me rediscover myself. Above all, returning home during breaks to mop floors, clean kitchens, and to wait on tables at my parents' restaurant, was among the best things that happened. For the disappointment and difficulty we struggled with together since the Chinese chefs fled after acquiring work visas, we learned to join hands and support each other. After all, life is such a pleasant surprise, propelling me to better connect, move forward, and enjoy in ways I had not imagined."
"Using computing skills to help engineers build and operate solar-energy generator for school facilities was a great extension of my interest in technologically applying knowledge. This experience was distinct from maintaining and repairing air-conditioners on campus, for the complexity of science, math, and economics involved. Computing the generator development plan opened my eyes wider to relevant disciplines that work so closely, and to future ideas of enhancing the generator design and distribution. Furthermore, learning additional languages including Fortran, I was fortunately able to show my ability to comprehend issues of complexity and compute necessary information to qualify for my summer bioengineering research assistantship at Seoul National University. I also joined forces with the University computer science majors to develop a practical software for bioengineering-related experimentations. This series of computer science-related experiences has really excited me to look forward to exploring CS in college."
"My Emory visits began and ended with conversing with Emory students about the impact of changes taking place in their lives. Many examples of their changes taught me how ""interaction"" is so vital to forming vibrancy and life in college. And embodying this veracity is Emory's curricular flexibility and educational philosophy embracing differences in background, culture, and idea, yet nurturing camaraderie, creativity, and leadership. As ""people"" shape the best of a community, I was convinced that Emory is a natural extension of my high school experience in which ""interaction"" and ""people"" fueled the dynamics of academic and social lives each day."
"My parents were born in the heart of Afghanistan: a humble nation in Southwest Asia with a rich culture and rapidly developing economy. Seventeen years later, they prepared to graduate with honors. A month prior to graduation, the Soviet Union deployed troops across Afghan borders. Within weeks, Afghanistan was plunged into grueling war. Streets my parents called home became battlefields: roads blocked by barricades of tanks and barbed wire. As warfare and bloodshed consumed my native land, my parents made the decision to flee the country, leaving behind everything. For five days and nights, they trekked through sweltering deserts and treacherous terrain towards transport in neighboring Pakistan. They arrived penniless in the United States, my newborn brother in hand, with a responsibility to provide for their siblings and parents. Rather than cowering in the face of adversity, my parents slaved away, working multiple minimum wage jobs to make ends meet. Throughout my life, my family has endured bouts of grief and incessant financial hardship, but I was shielded from these pressures as they prepared me for the tribulations of living in a low-income household. Often I came home from school to a note reading: ""Mommy and Daddy are working late tonight, do what you need to do."" ""Do what you need to do"" is the maxim by which my life has been ruled since the words first escaped my father's lips. It is difficult to follow that directive when you live in an often empty home, frequently devoid of parental guidance and support. It is difficult when you witness your parent's mental and physical will deteriorate as they come home from yet another double shift, only to struggle to make a mortgage payment. It is difficult, indeed... but not impossible. I developed a determination to make the best of a challenging situation through simple perseverance, though I admit my perspective was rather one-dimensional. While my parents' struggle had revealed that not every individual is granted an opportunity to effortlessly prosper in life, I did believe that if you ""do what you need to do,"" you would succeed. In a single afternoon, that facade was shattered. I was raised in a multicultural community of immigrants from across the globe. These families, like mine, entered America with aspirations of establishing prosperous lives through sheer effort and hard work. There was one difference, though: the majority of their families were not granted legal residence in the United States. I had not thought much about this dissimilarity; at a cursory glance the circumstances in which they lived were no different than mine. But I was wrong. On a fateful afternoon in 2011, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency raided neighborhoods across my community. I recall stepping outside, staring helplessly as my neighbor was forced from his home and thrown into the back of a police truck. Ceaseless crying and screams filled the air as mothers and fathers were separated from their naturalized children. I could not make sense of it. They worked hard; they did what they had to do-but it was not enough. I was unnerved. This event brought upon a significant change of identity, as my eyes were opened to the injustice plaguing our world. I now know what I aspire to be. Before my parents were forced to become refugees, they planned to pursue careers in law and service. I will follow in their footsteps. I have witnessed the strain and injustice immigrants face and I endeavor to be in a position to provide relief. The immigration process is unforgiving, and beginning a new life and assimilating is even more difficult. By gathering experience in law and community advocacy, and pursuing a career in policy, I can make the change that I believe must come. I will ""do what I need to do"" to eliminate the inequity that millions in this nation endure."
"Philosopher John Dewey once said, ""education is not preparation for life; education is life itself."" But what happens when society's ""definition"" of life changes? This issue is stirring within our nation. Education reform is becoming an extremely prevalent issue, one inherently difficult to confront. Public education in the U.S. has not experienced a significant change in the past century. However, there are two trends that are slowly forcing an educational revolution: increasing prevalence of technology in our lives, and increasing multiculturalism within our nation and its classrooms. Common Core is becoming obsolete: innovation occurs too frequently for policymakers to establish new standards, and diverse classrooms are abandoning ""one size fits all"" lesson plans. The challenge lies in finding an efficient way to teach millions of unique students, without compromising quality of education. It is of paramount importance that we find this balance, because an improperly educated generation ensures future difficulties."
"Change. A change of setting: my home will always be dear to me. Still, I maintain a desire to explore beyond the boundaries of my neighborhood, to ingrain myself in a community-like that of Emory-offering unfamiliar and unique opportunities for intellectual and social growth. A change of peers: there is beauty in meeting new people. Each individual has the capacity to impact another's life in a unique way. This effect is only magnified in a diverse environment of intelligent students. Remaining in the same circle would only deprive me of this opportunity to develop. A change of identity: the cumulative effect of new experiences is a natural shift in an individual's perspective and behavior. No institution breeds more new experiences than college, and therefore, no institution develops an individual's perspective more than college. I eagerly await the opportunity to experience further development of my own perspective."
"One Saturday in October after lessons, I was walking along the river Itchen as the sun was setting. The only sound that could be heard was the buzzing of a lone bug, which evoked lines from John Keats' poem Ode to Autumn, which he wrote during a visit to Winchester. ""While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue; Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn"" At that moment, I realized that I was not only walking in the footsteps of John Keats, but was also living what I was studying. I wondered how the paths I walked differed from when Keats walked them and whether he watched the brown trout contrasted against the white-chalk-riverbed as I did. Growing up in London, a cultural and intellectual centre since its Industrial Revolution, I have had the opportunity of being surrounded by what I was studying. On my way to see friends in the East-end, I would pass St. Paul's Cathedral. On my way to see my father after work, I would pass the current Fourth Plinth installation at Trafalgar Square. I imagined how people watched as Nelson's column was erected in Trafalgar Square with the same curiosity I had when The Fourth Plinth was being changed. While the ever changing art installation atop The Fourth Plinth contrasts heavily with its surroundings, it was designed to be there. Paradoxically, like everything around it, The Fourth Plinth is in the environment which it was intended it to be seen. The education system is often geared primarily towards exams. Winchester College, my secondary school, emphasizes learning for its own sake through independent study. Living in the environment where I studied has produced a unique cultural and intellectual experience for me. Living in Europe has allowed me to see art in the original context in which the artist envisioned it. To quote the British philosopher Alan Watts, ""Museums are places where art goes to die."" Whether through visits to the Globe Theatre to see productions of Hamlet or Macbeth, or trips to Venice to study Venetian painting in situ, I was seeing these works of art in their original environment and these were powerful experiences for me. A personal favorite was to the Scrovegni chapel in Padua to see Giotto's Lamentation of Christ. Winchester College prides itself in teaching ""Div"", a unique, non-examined, academic subject. In my final year at Winchester, my Div class set its syllabus and covered topics that may not otherwise have been studied. These ranged from throwing pots to learning about 17th-century London as well as various operas including Antony and Cleopatra. I believe that the education I have received went beyond preparing me for exams and provided me with a way of thinking that otherwise may not have come until later in life. Before attending Winchester, I understood that London was one of the biggest cities in the world. However, I did not grasp the artistic, musical and cultural contributions London has made. During my first year at Winchester, I viewed my school and the surrounding city as a ""pretty"" place to study but I failed to grasp the importance of the City of Winchester in English history or the religious and architectural importance of the cathedral. However, as I matured, I began to understand that I was living what I was studying. During my final two years at Winchester College, I studied Economics, History of Art and English. I was constantly surrounded by various styles of architecture. These ranged from Jane Austen's Georgian house on campus, to the Gothic cathedral where we studied the architectural aspects as well as the frescos which had survived the Reformation. Attending Winchester College and growing up in London have fundamentally informed my appreciation for history, art, culture and view of the world"
"I believe the biggest challenge facing my generation is coping with decisions made by previous generations. My generation's values and vision for the future are in many cases not only different from those of my parents' generation or grandparents' but are often in conflict with them. Brexit occurred due to voter apathy and competing visions of Britain's role in Europe and the world. The demographic with the highest voter turnout was 90 percent for those over 65 which voted overwhelmingly to leave. They believed Europe was the primary source of Britain's problems. My generation sees Europe in a more constructive light, offering numerous personal and professional opportunities. The UK voted to leave the EU. As a result, my generation and future generations will continue to face the consequences of this vote, long after the older generations, who were the driving force of this referendum, have passed from the scene."
"I am curious by nature and this curiosity, coupled with a desire for ever greater independence and self-sufficiency motivates me to learn. Maturity is not about age but instead about an ability to function independently in ones environment. Whether by reading a Shakespearian play from which important life lessons can be gleaned, or learning to cook for myself and my sister when my parents are away, I am able broaden my perspective and expand my repertoire of independence-granting life-skills. Knowledge affords you greater opportunities in life: the ability to make informed decisions, think rationally and attempt to understand the world around you. I understand that many do not recognize the importance of learning in this way. However, I believe that important learning occurs outside the classroom as well and regardless of where it occurs, this drives progress within society."
"The power of denial No. Nao. Non. Nicht. Nach. There are many ways to react to such a small and frightening, nonetheless necessary and powerful word. Dealing with denial is a hard task. I remember feeling disappointed and helpless as my parents gave me the verdict about the Endevvr summer program. We had no possibilities of financing it by ourselves; all of our attempts were not enough. I felt like a character in a video game where every time I defeated an evil villain, a stronger one appeared. However, I could not give up on that chance. Attending Endevvr would be like defeating the main villain and unraveling the ""business world"" level. In it, I would unlock the knowledge to manage companies and develop actionable solutions for problems, while learning valuable skills for my professional life. I yearned for that, so I had to find a way out. I have always refused to view money as a limitation for those who aim high. After all, everything in my life, regardless of price, has been achieved through much hard work, and I have always treated every opportunity as if it were golden. Endevvr could not be different, and I would not give up without a good fight. So I bet all my chips in that game and began a crowdfunding campaign. Having recently moved to a new city, my contacts were restricted to classmates and school faculty. I started with them, but once again received a ""no."" I bounced back by getting in touch with the local newspapers, and in the next edition of Gazeta Regional, my story was in the headline of the ""Education"" section. I thought my problems were over and everyone would help me fight against my villain. Unfortunately, I was wrong. With still no significant progress in my crowdfunding, I searched for other sponsors, from the City Hall, the City Council, and the Secretary of Education to the local colleges, businesses, and nonprofits. They all said they were inspired by my story, my proactivity, my presentation skills and, above all, my resilience. Nonetheless, all of them had a justification: ""Brazil's crisis,"" ""bureaucracy,"" ""non-familiarity with crowdfunding,"" ""lack of time to analyze the proposition."" I heard everything. I tried everything in my power and beyond, but I ran out of time. The payment deadline arrived and I did not have sufficient funds: the villain had defeated me. Knowing I gave my best but could not succeed was excruciating. I had an expectation that I would somehow manage to have a happy ending like those in heroes' adventures, but my game was played in the ""real life"" mode. You might think my ending was sad: after all, I did not get to attend Endevvr, and some would even consider all my efforts to have been in vain. Though at first I thought my story had ended as an affirmation that life is not about happy endings all around, I realized that some losses are inevitable and that a problem should not be regarded as an adversity, but as an opportunity for learning. Sometimes life does not go as planned, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, had I not received the initial ""no"" due to my financial conditions, I would never have contacted and pitched to so many people, developed my negotiation and persuasion skills, or discovered that although my crowdfunding failed, it was not shameful to accept defeat, learn from it, and move forward with my head held high. By pursuing my goals despite continuous rejections, I learned what perseverance truly means and I even got a taste of what I would have experienced in Endevvr. My experience showed me that there is no ending in a story after the ""no,"" because to every ""game-over"" there is always a ""play again."" And now I am going to start a new match more driven than ever."
"Open the New York Times, or maybe El Pais. Then try Le Monde, Asahi Shimbun, or any other newspaper. In the first page you will see big headlines and analyses of how immigration impacts ""invaded"" countries, unfairly blaming immigrants for all socioeconomic issues. High unemployment rate? Reduced purchasing power and stagnant economy? All supposedly immigrants' fault. But what draws my attention is what is not written in those pages: all these issues culminated in an increasing wave of conservatism and intolerance. This mindset has terrible consequences such as retrograde policies, violence, and fear, a combination that results in extremism. My generation will reap what this intolerance sowed - and there is nothing that worries me more. Not bending to the extremism we face today is a worldwide challenge for my generation. It is a long path, but we must trail it by solving intolerance with inclusion, and ignorance with knowledge."
"If you ask any Brazilian to sing the tune ""Deixa a vida me levar"", you can be sure he/she will know it by heart. I, however, never enjoyed the song's lyrics. The message behind them, ""let life take its course, things will follow their own path,"" praises a lifestyle of passivity and simply waiting for opportunities to come by. This ideology can be observed everywhere, even in my classroom, in which grasp of the material was regarded as only a means to pass tests, instead of as a powerful key that could open endless doors. For me, knowledge gives me tools to create my own path and impact the world by understanding the whys and hows of global issues while picturing tangible ways to solve them. It empowers me to take the first step and see my ideas come to life and actively transform people's lives."
"After the third dramatic episode of barging out of the house into the cold night with my tiny pink suitcase, my parents finally dragged the kicking, squealing 'me' into the house. My father sat down, half amused, half exasperated. ""Darling, there is no Hogwarts. Magic isn't real... I'm sorry."" Those words might have knocked the air out of any other kid, but not me. For me, it was all too real to dismiss. Nine years ago, I woke up in the cupboard under the staircase, with a screaming Aunt Petunia. I had rushed through a crowded Diagon Alley, ran through an opaque platform, heard the whistle of the Hogwarts Express as I sped of to a world of magic. But this was the least of my adventures. In my little blue room, I had sailed through the Amazon river, discovering the wonders of the rainforest, shot up in a great glass elevator made of sugar with Willy Wonka, fought against the Egyptian God Set and brought down the Red Pyramid, and countless more. It took me a bookshelf full of adventure and an obscene amount of courage to tell my parents it was time for me to adventure outside the four walls of my room. Eleven years old, 5 feet confident, I went off to Copenhagen for art camp. In a month, I experienced the freedom of walking on stone pavements, feeling the cool breeze on my face as my soul began to connect with the colorful buildings and street side musicians who created wonders for a few cents in their guitar case. So, I opened my little purple diary, and I wrote about it. At the age of 12, I decided to go off to boarding school, thousand miles from Mumbai- the first of my (then shocked) relatives to leave the comfort of four walls and family. I began to call it home when I fell in love with the squirrels outside my window and the smell of eucalyptus everywhere, the friends who became family and the teachers that became mentors. And I opened my diary and wrote through five years of bliss. My experiences gave me a certain power over my writing. When I went to France for an exchange program, I began writing about my 'amour' and my 'ennui', my extremely forward friends and backward host family. I discovered the pleasures of writing in a different language, finding words that have no exact translation. I then wrote about diving into the depths of the Indian Ocean, the small but vibrantly colored fish, the slight burn of the salty water and the thousand shades of blue. I wrote about the time I almost fell of my white water raft in Croatia and the rush I felt when I ziplined through mountains in Cambodia. I will write about climbing the heights of Mt. Kilimanjaro, but mostly about each day before, when I had to train for hours to reach a seemingly impossible goal- reaching the peak of the world's tallest self-standing mountain. I realized I was a storyteller. I was able to weave details that I made in my mind into my experiences, and create the magic I was in love with. Today, when I see heaps of journals lying in my cupboard, my tiny purple one covered with dust collected over the years, I can say that if I had to give myself an identity, I would be an explorer, who hopes to one day share her stories with the world. Someone who could make the reader feel my passion for adventure from their own little room. I know today that a thousand journeys await me and my unseen audience someday, and in the words of Gerald Gould, ""And come I may, but go I must, and men if you ask why/ You may put the blame on the stars, the sun, the white road and the sky"""
"Innovation in technology is transforming our world. As more technical inventions appear, the danger of humans being replaced by machines increases. The greatest challenge facing our generation in the next few years will be to keep ahead of technology as the 'work crisis' becomes a frightening reality. We cannot rest on our laurels or on certain skill sets with new inventions executing jobs more efficiently. From virtual classrooms replacing teachers, to robots requiring less labor, technology is always competing. This problem is magnified in my populated country, India. Our education systems will have to develop a flexibility of mind and versatility of skills so we become a generation capable of reinventing ourselves. Today, we need to develop skills that technology cannot replace- have knowledge that one can't obtain through Google, have skills one can't buy in a machine, have people depend upon you for support instead of their laptops."
"I have always been an all rounder, with a love to explore new areas of thought. Being a writer has made me a curious person, leading to me being a voracious reader as well. I am most excited by the inter-disciplinary opportunities at Emory which do not cast me into predetermined boxes. Joining the liberal arts program as an undecided major meets my need to explore several fields that widen the spectrum of my learning. I look forward to following my interest in the arts, literature, history, languages as well as taking extremely diverse classes in gender studies, biology and environmental science. I hope to join a varsity sport, play musical instruments, compose my music, sing and organize cultural events to celebrate the school's diversity. The freedom of choice and flexibility at Emory will ensure that I thrive in an environment that encourages students to break comfort zones."
"I have always wanted to be a politician. When I heard Dwight D. Eisenhower's dignified farewell address and, later, John F. Kennedy's powerful speeches, I determined that politics is the field I am to be involved in. Even so, there are certain attributes necessary to succeed as a politician, which I undoubtedly lack. I am the victim of diffidence, speech anxiety, and an introverted personality; three disadvantages that dragged me away from my dream and brought me eyeball to eyeball with my own failures. When I first said I was intended to go into politics, my family and friends were astonished and concerned. I was not surprised by their reactions. I knew my demeanor was not a good fit. I find public speaking a nightmare. I was often told that I was a mumbler and trembler on stage, and that my speeches and presentations at school were neither powerful nor convincing. Often, my teachers and family would say I seem insecure. I used to walk with my head down and my back slightly hunched. The truth was hurtful. Over time, I was convinced that I was not born for politics. I devoted myself instead to ideas of career paths that require less talking and contact with people. For a period of time, I simply followed suggestions. I decided to be more involved in science when my sister told me that I would only need to communicate and please the colleagues in laboratories. Going through the toilsome search for suitable career paths, I came to the conclusion that I cannot fit perfectly in any of them. My disadvantages that devastate my hope of pursuing my passion reminded me of King George VI of the United Kingdom, a stammerer who fought through his defect and delivered a speech that brought up British morale during the second world war. This encourages me to pursue my real passion - politics. I know that this is going to be a journey full of failures. However, great leaders are nurtured through failures and painful trials. I learnt that pursuing passion is never easy, but a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory."
"I fell in love with one of Radiohead's albums - The Bends at the age of 15. The reason I'm so infatuated with their music is the fact that I can form connections with their meaning-rich lyrics. Among the songs in the album, Fake Plastic Trees is the one that provokes my emotions. As the name Fake Plastic Trees suggests, the song is centered on the theme of fakeness. The three stories that make up the song critiques the materialistic life people pursue. However, the verse that concludes his song: ""If I could be who you wanted"" expresses the melancholy that people are forever trapped in this lifestyle because it is part of human desire. As a city folk, I lived a materialistic life. Yet, I am unable to escape this lifestyle because there is always a part of me that defines success as having been surrounded by luxuries."
"My ideal academic environment has small class size lectures, where I can get individual attention from the professors and be truly involved in the class. As an introvert, small class sizes encourage me to participate in class discussion and further contribute my insights into lectures. Liberal arts education is incorporated into the curriculum, which will equip me with in-depth knowledge from various fields of studies upon graduation. The campus is located in suburbia that has easy access to downtown, allowing me to thoroughly explore American culture. As it is my dream to benefit the world through political activism, the ability to think logically and communicate effectively are what I wish to gain from my college education. Logic allows me to be critical, which helps me gain insights into world issues; great communication skills can open doors for leadership positions in the political sector, where I can endeavor to serve people."
"I am a worship leader. This title is one that I dreamed about, felt rejected by, stood firm in, ran away from, and recently felt called back to. At seven years old, I boldly declared what I wanted to be when I grew up. I confidently listed off veterinarian, CEO, gospel singer to those who curiously asked me. However, by middle school, the dream of becoming a gospel singer remained the only one that I progressively grew more passionate about. At eleven years old, I applied, auditioned, and joined the worship band for my church's youth group. With the rest of the team consisting of high school students, they were unsure of what to do with me. During those first years, I enjoyed setting up and breaking down chairs and running errands, but the feeling of rejection crept in as I saw other members, who joined the team after me, join the band on stage. I felt neglected, but refused discouragement. The neglect fueled the resilient fire within my heart that kept steady in believing my contributions to the team mattered. With even more resolve, I continually upheld responsibilities granted to me in chair duty and water delivery. I gladly served in every way possible because I felt that a leader should know how to serve. Leadership changed seasonally as people moved or graduated out and, through observing each one, I refined my understanding of leadership. When the opportunity came for me to lead, I wanted to be equipped to lead well. On a typical Friday night, one of the leaders asked me to take his song for the night because his voice was too strained. My heart rate accelerated above 100 bpm as I agreed to lead for the first time on stage; it was quite literally ""on the spot"". I assumed that it went well because I was put into the weekly rotation from this moment on. From age fifteen until graduation, I had the privilege of stepping into a leadership position on the team. These years were crucial in cultivating the character of leadership I possess today, but were straining to the point where I felt unqualified to lead. Catching myself feeling entitled to having people follow my instruction and to listen to everything I said, I realized that the focus of leading this team had shifted from serving them first. After graduating, I wanted to quit worship leading because I feared that continuing to lead would jeopardize what I desired to and fought to keep over the years: a humble heart. However, this past summer I was invited to lead at different youth retreats. Deciding that these opportunities would be the last before closing the door to this passion of mine, I traveled to St. Simon's Island and Panama City Beach. As the summer ended, I stepped out of worship leading and stepped into an internship. While entering into internship at the International House of Prayer, I unsuccessfully shut the door to leading worship. I found myself missing what fear of pride had cause me to run away from: leading others in worship. Being in an environment that facilitates incessant live worship and prayer, I realized in these three months that over the past seven years, worship leading has transitioned from my dream to my reality. Spending these past months to reflect on my journey as a worship leader has filled my heart with gratitude and confidence to face my fear of developing a selfish heart fed by entitled leadership. Remembering the process of how people and difficult moments have shaped me as a compassionate leader and passionate worshiper, I rest in the revelation that a thankful heart leads to a humble heart. Worship leading has taught me that a good leader acts and speaks from the heart. Practicing a lifestyle of thankfulness, I will continue cultivating a humble heart that loves to lead by serving."
"Immense pressures facing this generation involve stressing to meet various standards set by society, friends, and family. Expectations will continue to increase due to the fast paced culture of today resulting in unprecedented levels of mental distress. This explains why suicide rates are rising each year and how, currently, suicide is the second leading cause of death among the youth. My generation is expected to carry the future, however, this is an impossible reality to place before a generation in which depression, anorexia, bulimia, and anxiety disorders are crippling. We must develop ways to address and mend the brokenness unseen in the physical, but found in the mental state of individuals. Health enables and disables people from pursuing their dreams and passions. Therefore, intentionally meeting mental health needs on the same level as physical needs is crucial for my generation to boldly face the challenge of building a better future."
"The Lion King is my favorite movie. When Mufasa shows up in the sky with thundering and majestic storm clouds, it is an awesome moment of breakthrough for Simba. This scene moves me deeply because, when Mufasa speaks to Simba, he doesn't bring up the past or Simba's immaturity in hiding in the wilderness. Instead, Mufasa surfaces the true core identity of Simba as his son and as the rightful heir. Prior to this encounter, Simba was too discouraged to recognize the authority he already possessed as the son of the mighty king. Being reminded of who he is, Simba is freed from the heaviness of his past mistakes and present confusion. He begins pursuing his potential by returning home to restore order and establish justice with authority. I love the redemption of Simba's life through receiving the revelation of his identity because this is what many people desperately need."
"I began cooking, at eleven, as the result of my picky tastes. As a kid, I refused to eat eggs, cakes, corn dogs, and bananas, as well as macaroni that wasn't stuck individually on the tines of a fork. I wanted to make food I enjoyed. The first dish I set out to cook was custard, which had always seemed so straightforward when my grandmother made it. My ""recipe"" consisted solely of boiling milk with sugar. Instead of the creamy, delicious custard I'd planned on, I got a thin, sickly yellow liquid with clots of burnt milk. Even after I'd added large amounts of cinnamon and cardamom with generous scoops of ice cream, the slurry never thickened, and tasted repulsive. I poured it down the drain and turned my attention to the sink full of burnt pots. My botched attempt at custard didn't diminish my enthusiasm for cooking, and I managed to make steaks that tasted good. I forged ahead with ambitious recipes like coq au vin, cassoulet, and croissants, resulting in grease fires on the stove, parchment-paper fires in the oven, and a kitchen covered in melted butter. Even though I was cooking constantly, I insisted to my parents that I hadn't worked in the kitchen and that the sink had been that dirty when they left. I wasn't ready to admit I'd begun a hobby I considered a ""weird thing"" that none of my friends, or any adult males I knew, enjoyed doing. I would cook when I had the house to myself, and relished the peace and freedom to do things as I saw fit. Cooking allowed me to be adventurous in my otherwise cautious childhood. I came to realize that I loved both the thrill and the calm of experimenting in the kitchen. Cooking became sanctuary for me. Eventually, I shared my newfound love with my parents. Aside from having the freedom to cook more often, I could now get a wider range of supplies. I'd eagerly go to the store to buy exotic groceries, the cashier having to ask what kind of chilies I was buying, what Mimolette cheese was, and what I was doing with monkfish, scallops, clams, and three other kinds of fish. I ordered Escoffier and several obscure cookbooks online and sous-vide machines to make short ribs with 72 hours of enzymatic braising. Word that I'd begun to cook spread around school. Last year, my English teacher ""volunteered"" me - during class, with everyone laughing - to phone grocery stores and find where I could buy a goose, which I'd then roast for the school's Thanksgiving feast. The following week, my worry of serving the whole school raw poultry caused the finished goose to be tough, but the experience introduced me to cooking for others. For my friend Martha's birthday in April, I baked a chocolate raspberry cake with mirror glaze. I liked that the cake's glossy outside not only served as its gift wrapping but also concealed any interior imperfections. Over time, the shortcomings in my cooking have helped me move past the urge to hide mistakes. Many of my imperfections - both personal, like shyness, and culinary, like the tough goose - are better met by acknowledging them. And you can't really hide your flaws anyway. Even the glaze didn't completely cover what was beneath, with the crooked layers showing through on the sides. In cooking, I've found a hobby I love and enjoy - one that I can pursue throughout my life. I wonder if I'll continue to find sanctuary in cooking. I wonder if I'll continue to find new dishes to challenge me, or if I'll perfect the old ones. I wonder what I'll be making for my friends' birthdays in twenty years. And I wonder which of my other frailties cooking will help me accept or resolve in the future."
"My ideal college would let me explore my wide range of interests, from sciences like biology, physics, and chemistry, to math and the humanities. Emory's unusual strength in both the humanities and the sciences would not only offer me a glimpse into the fascinating intersection of these two branches of knowledge but also allow me to further my scientific studies and dive into Emory's creative writing and literature programs. Coming from a small town with a tightknit community, I'd enjoy sharing my perspectives and exposing them to the plethora of viewpoints and cultures at Emory and in Atlanta. I'd love to tour landmarks like Martin Luther King Jr.'s house and explore the CDC's cutting-edge research. Emory and the Atlanta area would be a great home for my next four years of social, intellectual, and cultural discovery."
"My love of discovering and understanding previously unfamiliar aspects of the universe motivates my drive to learn. The sciences spark this sense of marvel in me, from neuroscience - which deals with something as close, and yet as cryptic, as our brain - to the physics of distant galaxies. My interest in the sciences goes back as far as I can remember. As a three-year-old, I implored my parents to read me ""bedtime stories"" from the Big Book of Knowledge because I was fascinated to learn how the body works. At five, I used my first microscope to discover the wonders of a previously unseen world. At twelve, I received permission to cover our kitchen counter with sterile drapes and grow staph in the oven. Today, I approach all my learning using a scientific methodology: empirically and objectively."
"""What are you going to do? Count birds?"", my mother's voice echoed in my head, while the sound of gunshots lingered in the air. I heard people have flashbacks before they die, but I did not believe it until now. Around me, the crowds are fleeing in despair. Survival instincts make me do the same, whereas my mind starts reconsidering past events. How is it possible that I find myself in the middle of a revolt in the Istanbul airport? Will I die in the following moments? If so, was it worth it that my last discussion with my parents was an argument? I trip but somehow manage to rise before getting squashed by the waves of people. As my running resumes, so does my involuntary memory. I see myself in school, enthusiastically discovering the enchanted world of science. From there to participating in Olympiads, it was not a long way. Competitions did enhance my abilities, but with more obstacles than expected: unfairness, unscrupulous competitors, outdated textbooks. Yet I refused to give up and I let myself guided by my curiosity. Another stampede ignites. I hide behind a bench, crushed between veiled figures feverishly uttering prayers and my horrified teammates. Similarly chaotic was senior year, filled with the frustrations of upcoming graduation exams and university admissions. Along came a shift in my parents' attitude: the Biology Olympiad was no longer a noble endeavor, but a waste of time. In this context I discovered how carefully my life was planned ahead, without my knowing. Regardless of my wishes, my parents wanted me to study Medicine and become a doctor. As an only son, I could not let my parents down. I had to show my gratitude and honor their wishes. Nevertheless, parental opposition did not stop me from achieving at least one long-held dream - qualifying for the International Biology Olympiad. The building is shaking from the shockwaves of who knows what. I recall being reluctantly driven by my parents to the airport a few hours earlier. ""Why do you have to go to Vietnam? Can't you stay at home like a normal child?"", my mother said. ""At least it will be over soon and then you can prepare for medical school"", my father added. ""Or I won't"", I harshly affirmed with negligent sincerity. The car shook slightly. My mother replied, ""Don't start again with that Biology thing. What are you going to do? Count birds?"", but I continued, ""Grandma told me she didn't let you study Biology as you wanted. We don't have to repeat the same mistakes. If Biology in Romania is underdeveloped, I'll go abroad. If Biology doesn't pay enough, I'll take two jobs. This is what I want to do and I will deal with the consequences. When will you stop smothering me?"". It was saddening to see my mother's teary figure in the rear-view mirror. ""Young and naive"", my father mumbled. This is how, together with the Romanian Olympiad Team, I got here, stranded during the layover in Istanbul, on our way to Vietnam. Caught in the middle of a military coup, I am weighted down by fear and worries. Did I make the right decision? It appears that all these circumstances are against me. A South African woman hopelessly tries to appease her terrified child. Does it mean I should not continue on this path I have chosen? Demonstrators are violently parading through the airport. Was all I have done in vain? Then suddenly the answer came from my heart. Yes, it was worth arguing with my parents because I was doing it for my ideals. If this is what it takes for me to do Biology, then so be it. I will continue working hard and one day become a renowned scientist. After almost 24 hours from our arrival in Istanbul, a rescue flight received permission to land and take us home."
"In my quest to understand how tiny strands of atoms - the DNA - manage to control the entire living world, I came across many books. Klug's Concepts of Genetics proved to be just what I needed and more. Not only have I become aware of the complex genetic mechanisms governing our lives, but, from the Special Topics section, I have also found out about the latest discoveries made in Forensics, Genomics, Epigenetics and Stem Cell research. Most intriguing to me was Pharmacogenomics, a new branch of Genomics which promises to revolutionize the concept of ""personalized medicine"". Through Pharmacogenomics, physicians are looking to adapt treatments to each patient's specific genome in order to increase therapeutic efficacy. Pharmacogenomics is already providing outstanding results and Klug's textbook has been a real eye-opener. I cannot wait for the future discoveries in this field and, hopefully, to one day partake in making them."
"The alarm clock rings. I stretch to hit snooze, but then I see my lab coat and I jump right out of bed. Yesterday I carried out spectrophotometric measurements of liposomal solutions. Maybe today I will have to setup a gel electrophoresis or I will finally get my hands on those fancy protein microarrays. I cannot wait to see what exciting lab techniques I will be learning today at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology! I may be just a lab assistant, but I love it: I get to find out about the latest discoveries just as they are being made. The current project focuses on tumor-associated macrophages and how changing their phenotype from protumoral to antitumoral may enhance targeted cancer therapies. One day, these experimental therapies might actually cure patients. In the meantime, early mornings are livelier than ever knowing that I am helping make the world a better place."
"Peanut butter and jelly, cookies and cream, yin and yang, me and my Rubik's cube. My friends make fun of me because I am attached to the cube. It has become a part of my identity, my trademark. If you ever go to New York's Penn Station, you can see masses of people standing, buried in their iPhones and reading Facebook; then you see me-buried in my Rubik's cube. You can say it defines me. To the uninitiated, it is a strange jumble of colors-a puzzle impossible to solve. But solving it is methodical and orderly, just like I am. You can say I am an inverted duck: calm above water, but frenetically pumping my legs below. At the surface I may seem chaotic-picture a board in a room filled with economic theory on whiteboards, posters on the wall filled with integration problems, yellow stickies with current inventory levels-yet I can still find a customer's order number. Call it methodical madness. The Rubik's cube is my window through which I learn to better handle and balance my world. But solving a Rubik's cube can be unpredictable, too. Sometimes the pieces move perfectly and the cube is solved in a couple of minutes, but, other times, the jumble stubbornly refuses to fall into place. Entrepreneurship is very much the same: sometimes an executed strategy falls in place and everything is perfect, yet other times it could go horribly wrong. I approach real world challenges, whether at school or in my business, like I solve a Rubik's cube-systematically, precisely, and at a fundamental level. Take the holiday orders my brother and I were banking on. We had made holiday sale projections and stocked our product accordingly, with buffer stock on the way. Our holiday sales beat expectations, but the buffer stock was stuck at customs and our shipping agent could not help much. It seemed there was no way I could get the product to our customers in time. In desperation, I reached out to a supplier, and as I transitioned from English to Chinese, he was a bit surprised. Consequently, he opened up more and gave a smaller supplier's name who could potentially fill our order-but unfortunately, could not package the razors like we wanted. Half a loaf is better than starving and so I spent the next two weeks packing product until my fingers bled. But at least we were able to salvage our holiday sales. I learned the best solutions to any problem might not always be immediately obvious. Creativity, and keeping an open mind and a willingness to communicate openly are necessities. Being methodical also proved to be an extraordinary virtue. I had to apply my mind in a structured fashion. No matter how chaotic the situation seemed at face value, I remained positive and executed solutions with precision, just as I had learned to do with my Rubik's cube. I intend to bring this systematic doggedness, entrepreneurial spirit, and can-do attitude everywhere I go. I am energized to tackle any puzzling situation. Twist and Turn. Twist and Turn."
"I am interested in economic justice and believe that a wider understanding of black markets would enable better public policy to combat the underground economy and improve the lives of countless people around the world. My time in India opened my eyes to black market ills everywhere. Public services suffer as governments become cash starved, and there is ubiquitous corruption in politics and public life. But India is not unique-most developing countries suffer from this malaise. Ultimately, this hurts any country's economy by hindering the creation of new jobs- which is potentially catastrophic for today's generation. Often created at the intersection of misguided public policy and free market forces, the black market must be tackled. It lowers tax revenue thus impacting government's ability to deliver services to today's students. This issue is absolutely crucial to deal with for the economic well being of my generation in years to come."
"One of my all-time favorite books is The Prize by Daniel Yergin, which begins with ""Rock Oil,"" and ends with the ""Age of Oil."" For any student of history and economics, this is a must-read. It is not just a story of oil but a story of entrepreneurship, a story of how and why wars are fought, won, or lost. The Prize is a book that has had a stirring effect on me. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I love gaining insight and learning from historical entrepreneurial endeavors, for example, how certain resources can impact and change history-a cornerstone idea in economic theory. This book has inspired me to further understand economics and to think about and tackle the economic issues (income inequality, tax loopholes, etc.) our society faces."
"It was 4 AM in Kingston when I got up. My eyes clouded with tears as I dressed. I went into my uncle's living room crowded with suitcases and bags. My dad was rambling angrily on the phone and my uncle was eyeing everything awkwardly like always. I went back into my room, looked in the mirror, and thought, ""Wow, I'm really leaving."" Imagine leaving the country that birthed, bathed, cleansed, and molded you. I would no longer flock to Hellshire Beach on Labour Day to sink my toes in the sand, eat escovitch fish, and watch a Rasta man cut sugar-cane. There would be no getting dressed for Grand Market Night on Christmas or going to Devon House to get rum-and-raisin ice-cream. My dad and I were getting ready to leave Jamaica and immigrate to the United States. He told me life in the U.S. was better. I wasn't sure where we were going- somewhere in Florida- but my new reality finally registered. I was going to leave my country, leave my mother, and board a plane, all for the first time. August 20, 2013 began a year of firsts for me. I would not have a chance to graduate from my high school, Wolmer's Trust High School for Girls, one of the best secondary institutions in Jamaica. Our curriculum was wide and varied, learning opportunities were equal, and we enjoyed being students of the school. I expected the same from my school in Miami. However, they didn't have some basic resources, like a school newspaper, as I expected. Despite my good grades from Jamaica, they put me in lower intensive classes. I had to work ten times harder for the things I wanted, whether that be writing opportunities or a high GPA. I had thought all schools in America had the same opportunities and resources, but apparently it wasn't so. That was a culture shock for me. I was happy living in Jamaica, but I was lost. I never really thought about my future or who I was. Being in America gave me the chances and resources to experiment with things I was good at. It started with my finding ways to adjust to my new surroundings. I would write love poems and finish books in a day. Then writing blossomed into a real passion. I started learning more about feminism and racial history in America. My poems became more complex, and I moved into writing essays and articles on my own. I had finally found my niche, both within myself and in America. I've performed my poetry on stage in front of thousands. I've been to Princeton University for a journalism program. I've done things I couldn't imagine three years ago. I'm a better person because of that hour and a half flight from Kingston to Miami. Of course, there are times when I struggle with my identity: sometimes I'm too American and not enough Jamaican. Nevertheless I've never been more confident in my talents, potential and future. Writing is the medium through which I want to change the world. I want to create a magazine in my homeland so I can help nurture artistic talent and give young journalistic voices a chance. I want to use my writing here in America to create spaces for minorities and others struggling to find their place. Although it was the biggest risk I ever took, migrating made me stronger."
"Improving literacy and critical thinking in education is one of the most important challenges for my generation. According to the Literacy Project Foundation, 50 percent of American adults cannot read a book at an eighth grade level. With so many Americans believing fake news, it is now more important than ever to teach people to think critically about what they read. That is why I created a community service project called ""It's LIT"" to enhance literacy. I started by helping raise the low literacy levels in my school, where 54 percent of our 9th and 10th students did not pass the state's English exam. To push this initiative, I organized book drives, I spoke with elected officials like my city's mayor, and I worked with literacy coaches in my school to discuss ways to raise literacy levels in our county. In the future, I hope to expand my organization to more communities."
"The part of Miami where I live is very suburban, so I want to attend college in an urban environment where the city is also your school. I imagine myself getting involved with city service projects and activism, as well as attending concerts and poetry events with friends. I want my college to be big, with all the amenities of a research university and the intimacy of a liberal arts college. It should be committed to diversity, service, social justice, and academic exploration. I want to be able to explore all my interests, from my academic passions in political science, sociology, and literature, to my extracurricular interests in activism, spoken word poetry, creative writing, and student journalism. I hope to leave college a better communicator and a better person."
"Throwing all caution to the wind, I would run down the dusty street. My bare feet hurt from stepping on the gravel road. With each step a volcano of excitement erupted inside of me. The thrill of watching Sekuru (grandfather), the mechanic perform his magic on cars overcame the pain from blisters on my feet as I made my way to the garage. My mother always told me not to loiter around the garage when Sekuru was at work. I just could not resist watching him battle with the engines and wheels and other complex yet simple looking parts of the car. I knew I would be in trouble with my mother. My irrepressible urge to understand that complex machine, car with its gears made me put trepidation aside and explore at the garage. I was in love with Sekuru's garage. It had all the marks of a place that has seen better days and fresh paint. I was only six but I loved seeing the grease smeared walls and the dark oil spots on the hard cement floor with his magnificent skill, Sekuru could rekindle any vehicle his customer had pushed into the garage. Sometimes it would seem like Sekuru was losing his magic touch. Because of determination he had to endure delayed lunch breaks sweat dripping on his forehead until he solved the puzzle. I was unafraid to ask no matter how silly the question sounded. I made it a mission to know each tool and its use. Sekuru would smile showing his tobacco stained teeth as he told me all the names of the tools he frequently used. Motivated by curiosity and Sekuru's willingness to answer, l excavated deeper into my interest by learning the simple parts of the car. Such exciting moments with Sekuru ignited my life fascination of problem solving. Sekuru would take us for a ride around our neighborhood after he finished fixing the cars. My mother did not seem to understand why I was so drawn to the garage. There was some sort of beauty in the garage greasy atmosphere. I did not view the place as dirty rather I saw the beauty in ratchets, wrenches and vice grips. With each sound a discovery and a solution was made. I saw possibilities at the garage. Each time I would nod in agreement while devising a way to sneak out again. Perhaps she did not like the suffocating smell of diesel that I carried from my adventure. Maybe it was the sight of my clothes stained and greasy hands covered in black lubricants that disturbed her. Whether it was from rolling under the vehicle with Sekuru or exploring the tool box, getting dirty was inevitable. Unfortunately my mother's objection was one of the many of the disapproval I would encounter. I was oblivious to the radiating looks of belittling and daggers the other boys were throwing in my direction as they grappled with the idea that a girl was invading their sacred territory. Some boys would go a step further to push me hard to the ground while their tongues lashed with cold blooded mockery. At first I used to cry but it was that thought of drifting away yet belonging fully to the universe that made me dust myself and stand up and stay. In 2005 operation restore order came and demolished illegal structures and the garage was among the structures. I watched in agony as the garage was reduced to dust leaving me with only memories to be cherished. I cannot see myself where I am without the unique experience I got at the garage. Each time I emerged a better critical think. Retrospectively the experience cemented in me a long life fascination with problem solving. The smile of contempt that Sekuru gave after fixing a car is one I want to experience my entire life, an exhilarating feeling."
"With each passing moment,people are devising ways to improve their way of entertainment. Gadgets are being modified for the better. I believe that my generation will lack social skills as more people are engrossing themselves in their gadgets.Parks which are famous for being ideal out door activities to catch up with family and friends will become but a thing of the past.People in my generation are letting social media and gadgets control their way of life. As a result, people are going to drift apart from their families and friends."
"My favorite book is Nelson Mandela's Biography,Long walk to freedom.It takes me from Mandela's childhood ,upbringing to him becoming a man.It shows his selflessness by putting his country's needs before his own needs.I love how much he sacrificed for his country.His story motivates me that instead of complaining about the current situation in my country,l should help in making it better by being a better citizen.The story motivates me that even when it may seem like all my dreams are moving to a graveyard,there is still hope to revive them.All it takes is commitment and sacrifices."
"Working for an education consulting company, I saw that quality education could not coexist with current government standards and that the Chinese people are seeking alternatives to break the existing limitation. What is the problem? The educational system concentrates on test preparation while failing to teach cultural literacy, critical thinking, and the skills to compete globally. Students memorize useless information for unfair tests designed to grant local students distinct advantages. At university, students' lives do become easier: attendance is optional; homework can be copied, exams leaked. Worse, the government uses the system to impart filtered history and biased views of the world to keep the population controlled. Due to these flaws, people turn to private education consulting firms to seek opportunities abroad. Instead of teaching students to write their applications, these firms do it for them, even suggesting false information to gain an advantage. I believe, however, that students can prepare for standardized tests and complete their own applications if correctly guided. Within these companies, educators face conflicting goals: they have to make a living by recruiting and signing on students; they also have to ensure the quality of the students' experience. The pressure turns responsible consultants into machines that disregard students once the contract is signed. There are other problems as well. The consultant who is in charge of signing on students is usually not the one writing the applications. Thus, promises are often broken. Further, exaggerated promises yield better results when it comes to signing on students, but then, when responsible consultants are telling the truth they are often regarded as disrespectful and pessimistic to the students. Aside from honesty issues, students are often given the same instructions to prepare application materials. Thus, all essays look alike, as do the application materials. Since consultants are often responsible for more than forty students, the quality of each student's application cannot be ensured. These companies are a toxic mix of privacy rights violation, forgery, and dishonesty. They cannot teach students English, equip them with the knowledge of how to write their own quality applications or to provide them a unique application as advertised. Moreover, real educators do not get a chance to perform their roles. Why is the problem of personal importance? I have been victimized by the Chinese educational system because it did not allow me to be a prospective professional soccer player and an academically prepared student at the same time. Last year, I was deceived by a Chinese educational company, to which my family lost ten thousand dollars. My entire educational plan was jeopardized, and in dismay, I met with a group of passionate educators who are dedicated to helping students. We joined the same company in the hope of gaining a resourceful platform to help other students; however, we were disappointed again. In this allegedly student-centered business, my friends and I were pressed to make profits at students' expense while failing to meet their needs. It is nevertheless my aspiration to help students to grow, to be inspired, and, more importantly, I want to create an environment for educators who will actually make a difference. What steps am I planning to take? I'll major in Education and minor in English and Business Administration and then pursue an MBA. Even while still a student, I would like to help my fellow students prepare for the TOEFL, the IELTS, and the SAT. I intend to attain the ETS, the College Board, the ESL, and the secondary teaching certificate. Meanwhile, I would like to start my quality education consulting company, while also working for an international school in China to gain teaching experience and build social connections. Once I reach enough students and gain enough experience, I would like to start a school dedicated to guiding and assisting students with their applications. Each word and each entry on the application should be the original work of the student."
"Living independently since the age of thirteen, I explored Russia, England, Thailand, and America where I learned that many people resent one another due to conflicting interpretations of a supposed ""single truth."" In the next fifty years, as the world becomes increasingly globalized, my generation face the challenge of being surrounded by a multitude of different cultures. The clash of cultures will turn the world into a giant mixing pot, where people can easily learn to hate each other. It is the natural tendency for people to defend their unique cultural intelligence and to judge from their own perspectives. The problem is often overlooked due to its indirect social influence, but, in fact, it is the cause of numerous ongoing conflicts. If this common practice is not properly guided for the next fifty years, it stunts not only international development but also causes worldwide disorder and discrimination."
"An academic environment that values creativity is something I learned to appreciate at work, a part of the experience that I truly desire. My job required me to write unique and innovative essays. However, after months of repetitive tasks, I am gradually losing my creativity to gain insightful approaches and momentum to explore new frontiers. The importance of education is no longer a concept. I need to master English and gain sufficient experience in Education and Business Administration to become mentally and professionally prepared to open my international school. My goal is transparent to me, and despite the time and the effort this goal will require, I am confident that a challenging undergraduate program can help me take the initiative. It is rather to say I am most excited about starting a meaningful career with Emory University than I am most excited about a specific part of the experience."
"I gazed in awe as I looked at the intolerable screaming children in front of me. I hurdled through the crowd of screeching, gleaming eyed, squealing children and shoved my way into my sweet and serene classroom. A sanctuary, free of uncanny sounds and movements. I then inhaled- three, two, and one, exhaled, and snapped myself back into reality. I was no longer in high school, no longer the student who ranted and yapped endless phrases to teachers who I now believe couldn't have cared less. As benign as it may sound, the student had indeed become the master. At the age of eighteen, I was now responsible for the lives of several eleven year olds. I felt empowered. Similar to the entrance of that of a Coachella Concert, the little monsters made their way into the class room. I made like a magnifying glass and cautiously observed the environment that was in front of me. To the far right corner of the room two girls snaffled at each other's pigtails as their bodies hovered onto the floors. By the busted window was a weeping foreign fellow, who simply wanted the warm embrace of his mother's arms. A bouncing football, a muddy floor, flakes of powdered chalk falling onto the tiles, kicking, screaming, boys and girls creeping. ""Everybody sit down!"" I exclaimed. Just like that the kids tousled around their seats and for a moment we peered at each other in silence. Although I do not intend to pursue a career in teaching, I realize the minute you become a guardian of some sort defines your perspective on parenthood. I consider my students to be that as if they were my own, I refuse to accept that most of my country's primary teachers are unqualified university applicants. I begin to think of governmental policies, financial obligations, and educational facilities amongst things that seem to matter. 'Adult' is not a label I would have typically presented upon myself at a post-teen age. I am no longer dependant on my parent, as I am my own source of income. I am learning patience, as working with children is not as easy as being one. I am becoming tolerable, especially when I teach math, as it's a subject with endless obstacles. I am developing skills I never would have seen myself use such as meditative and consultative exquisites, these which are rendered towards counseling children. This experience also provides me with challenges all of which allow me to set targets and monitor my progress in different projects. From writing reports, preparing schemes of work, setting assessment exams and educating children, I am multitasking without even realizing it. As the school grows, technological advancement has to modernize along with it. Here I am working alongside the school on various tech projects and machine set ups. I being one of the only two technicians employed, I have successfully set up a school emailing system acquired and operated by all staff members. I also contribute to the management and maintenance of the schools new and improved website. In terms of giving back to my schooling community, I teach and train both teachers and students how to use multiple computer components, as well as their software. Four months into my gap year teaching children in my local community has undoubtedly changed my perception and opinions on life. My sense of responsibly has enhanced from over a half to about 99.99 percent of what my contract legally obliges me to. I see myself growing and maturing into an adult, a hardworking, tax contributing member of society. I am contributing to the finances of my country and playing a key role in development. Educating children, who may in future become doctors, engineers or even leaders. Gaining work experience and understanding the impact of social expectations in the work field. I am officially the 1 percent trying to make a difference."
"I grew up in a very populated household, one of which I was reminded daily of my parent hurdles and sacrifices. To answer the question 'what motivates me to learn', I would have to say the constant reminder of fear and judgement of failure and disappointment. I consider myself lucky. I come from a country where education isn't exactly valued. Most parents would rather buy a new house or new car, basically live an extravagant lifestyle rather than that spend over $10000 on an international education for their children.My parents however chose to educate my sibling and I at International schools our whole lives. So when asked what motivates me to learn the answer would have to be, the fear of letting my parents down, and the thought of wasting their sacrifices and bearing no from my education. I prompt myself to be the best student I can be."
"My favourite television show would have to be Black-ish. The show is an urban demonstration of black lives and families in today's world and American society. For starters i enjoy its comedic portrayal of African American lives. It builds up on modern stereotypes, as well as provide alternative examples of how Black lives may in fact differ from expected beliefs. I further enjoy how they are able to present real life struggles and problems faced by the black community in the US. They take serious issues like the 'Black Lives Matter' campaign and find a way to spread the message across a larger platform. Black-ish is also a favourite show of mine, for it focused on several key family values. I grew up in a large family, so i am able to relate I with the show and its cast members. I really am looking forward to further seasons."
"After drama class, Yuan, a shabbily dressed girl, approached me. She held my hand tightly as we discussed her performance in drama class and her passion for singing. I found it harder and harder to match this bright girl beside me with her teacher's characterization: a problem at school. ""You know, you could be a star on stage someday,"" I said. ""But I am only a girl from a poor rural family, a left-behind child, and a bad student. It won't be possible."" Yuan responded shyly after a long pause. The light in her eyes dimmed. The influence of labels on her brought back memories. After moving from a small town to Beijing, my new classmates asked me why I didn't repeat a year to catch up with them. Also, I was not accepted in the choir because of my Southern accent and assigned to sit in the back row. For the first time, I experienced judgement based simply on where I came from. And no one expected much from me. However, I refused the stereotype placed on me and worked extra hard to overthrow those unfair underestimations of a non-native child: I earned first place in exams to show my capability; I ran for class president to win respect from my classmates; I represented my class to run the 1,500 meters in the track meet to impress my friends. Hearing the teachers' praise and meeting my friends' admiring stares, I felt that I had broken those fetters of unfair expectations. The label ""outsider"" couldn't define me nor stop me from achieving greatness anymore. Little did I know that I was fettered by a new label, not as annoying as the previous one but just as dangerous. That morning, the results of our midterm exams came out and the teacher read aloud my class rank: ""Twenty second."" My classmates stared at me, and my teacher looked at me disappointedly. ""Twenty second; not first, not second, not even third,"" I silently repeated. After class, the teacher asked me to her office and criticized my terrible performance on this exam. For the next two weeks, the disappointment of my teachers bothered me. I found myself was now defined by my rankings. These numbers are more dangerous than the label ""outsider"" because I secretly enjoyed the high rankings in my heart. Realizing their constraints on my pursuits, I wondered: if this dehumanizing value system of only focusing on grades and rankings diluted my passion for learning, why should I play by its rule? Again, I had fetters to break, but this time, not by proving myself, but simply by being myself and pursuing my passions regardless of how the results were perceived. And so, I try to live my life without the fetters of positive or negative labels. I attend world history class and philosophy seminar to seek nothing more than pure joy as I immerse myself in the cycles of human civilization and wrestle with the paradox of respect raised by Kant. Lingering in the palace in the Forbidden City, I marvel at the ineffable narrative calligraphy that convey passion and grief, belief and ideology and feel the vibrancy of the ticking clocks from the 19th century. Reading Eric Kandel's In Search of Memory at night, I revel at the joy of envisaging memory driving our minds. I envision the freedom of the mind to explore without limit and to think without obstacles, which allows me to discover the essence and beauty in art and science. The excitement I felt grappling with complex philosophical questions, Yuan felt singing her melody on the stage. ""Hey, don't flinch or let others' judgements confine your talents. Go contend for your goal!"" I faced Yuan, staring at her eyes. I wished I had said this to myself the day I started school in Beijing, but I was glad that I could tell her my story now."
"The Selfish Gene has unsettled me and revolutionized my understanding of biology. For the first time, I was exposed to a truly distinctive perspective of why people are the way they are, the central theme of human affairs. The concepts of kin selection and group selection, which elaborate the motivation and outcome of human choices, evoked self-reflection and drove me to rethink the issues around me. Is the single-child policy in China a selfish act or an altruistic act? Do the differences between sperm and egg determine the different positions and considerations of males and females in marriage? Dawkins' discussion triggers a chain of thinking over human nature and culture, renewing my views of cause-and-effect in the surrounding world. Moreover, it introduces me to the flourishing field of neuroscience, encourages me to explore the reward system which determines our choices, and makes me more conscious about my motivations and actions."
"I envision college as home, a place where I develop freely and feel a sense of belonging. At home, I feel relaxed yet constantly challenged. In its friendly environment, I can freely express my opinions on the dark period of modern Chinese history. Here, I can also immerse myself in various cultures and develop interests in philosophy and music, regardless of the boundary of discipline. In its intellectual atmosphere, I get chances to confront innovative yet challenging concerns on the moral crisis of gene-editing technology. At home, I feel I belong. Here, I know people similarly devoted to academics and sports. Playing a game of table tennis after a stressful day of classes, we open our hearts and build a closer bond with each other. Here, I can also integrate myself with the diverse community by involving others in reveling in this sport. Here, I am my happiest self."
"My grandfather fought in the Vietnam war; he joined the military when the American Army garrisoned in his hometown. In battle, his side lost, and he was imprisoned, leaving my grandmother to work alone for the remaining thirteen family members: her in-laws, her ten children and her. She had to take on all the work including farming, trading, and providing food and education for her children. They weren't rich and didn't have fancy clothes or delicious food, but all the children went to school and were never hungry. I've always admired my grandmother for what she could do even though she's only 4'8'' and 81 pounds. My mother inherited this ""gene"" of strength from her mom and raised me in the absence of my father most of the time. My father has been working in Hai Phong, about 70 miles from Hanoi, ever since he started working for the military when he was eighteen, so we're not close. Back then my mom was his brother's neighbor, and they met when he visited his brother in Hanoi. They quickly fell in love and continued their long-distance relationship even after marriage; because of work, he only comes home every two weeks or less. Because my dad isn't home often, my mom has much to do. My mom used to work late all the time, but when she got home, she had to manage everything by herself, helping me with homework and feeding me. She went to sleep really late, but the next morning she'd still wake up early and go to work. As I grew up though I started to learn that in Vietnam women ""need"" to be quiet and girly, marry a good man and then let him make money while they stay at home doing housework. Most importantly, a traditional Vietnamese woman should depend on her husband, both financially and emotionally. But for me, because my mom lives independently from my dad, I've always believed differently. My dad always helps my mom with housework when he's home, and my mom is so strong for doing so much by herself and not complaining about being tired. When I was young I didn't help much. I didn't think mom needed it if she didn't ask. This changed one night when my mom got very sick enough to come home early from work. Trying to help, I offered to cook dinner. It was the first time I went to the kitchen not to eat. My mom lay in bed and taught me everything, including how to wash the rice, add adequate water, and use the cooker. I followed her instructions and successfully cooked rice that meal. Actually it was the only thing I cooked that day as my mom didn't trust me with other dishes. While eating, my mom said it was the best rice she'd ever eaten, but I knew it wasn't. I added too much water, so it was almost like soup, terrible soup. I couldn't eat it, but mom acted like she enjoyed it. I realized how happy that small effort made her, so I began helping with other housework. Through that work I realized how satisfying it is to be independent. I then didn't have to wait for anyone to get things done for me because I can do everything myself. Not until then did I realize why my grandmother and my mom are happy despite living independently from their husbands. It's because they can make their own decisions and be in charge of their lives. Today, I know that the absence of my dad and the role models of my grandmother and mom helped me to mature, not only in terms of housework, but also in life, the way I view women, and my goals. I always make my own decisions because in the future, I want to become like my role models, strong and independent."
"Overpopulation is and will continue to be one of the most challenging problems in the world, especially in developing countries. In the future, its impacts will become even more serious. There are already more than 7 billion people in the world, and scientists have predicted the population will reach 10 billion in the next 50 years. More people means more living space, food, water and natural resources. However, the Earth can only produce so much, and it already can't satisfy our current needs. Moreover, the rise in the number of industries will continue to badly affect the environment, increasing the amount of CO2 and dust in the air and therefore aggravating global warming and air pollution. Many other issues involving water, soil and noise will also worsen. The best solution for this is to provide more information about family planning, sex education and the damaging effects of overpopulation."
"In Vietnam, mental illness isn't seriously considered. Many people here suffer from illnesses but cannot find help, so they tend to hide their ailments and suffer alone. The lack of therapists and psychological counselors in Vietnam makes it hard for those people to get help. Mental illness victims cannot get better if they keep suffering by themselves. Because of this, I want to become someone who can listen, understand, and give them professional advice. If I want to help, I have much to learn and this is a serious motivating factor in my life. I've not yet had much training in psychology, but I have the desire to learn everything about it, especially about clinical psychology, so I can fully understand how to help. My aim is to become a therapist and help people with mental illnesses. I will devote my life to it."
"I've had a passion for nature and the environment ever since I was a toddler. Every summer my family has taken a vacation to Cape Cod. The cottage we stayed in was located close to a tiny, secluded beach; to the right, past the private beaches, was a small inlet. The creek was teeming with life. I spent entire days catching crabs and snatching eels from under the rocks. The scup - a type of fish - bit nearly every cast. I loved to find conches and quahogs under the sand and watch all of the hermit and horseshoe crabs scurry along the ocean floor. These creatures fascinated me, and I enjoyed learning about their behavior. However, this once abundant ecosystem has turned into a smelly, lifeless, and polluted environment. The eels and conches are non-existent, the quahog and scup populations are dwindling rapidly due to over-fishing, and the crabs are finding new, less polluted homes. Even the once overabundant minnows are now a rare sighting. I've seen children torture animals instead of admiring their beauty. The transformation of such a beautiful place with an abundance of life to an oceanic dump makes me furious. I frequently hear about a species going extinct or the absurd amount of pollution being dumped into the ocean and the environment all around the world. Every time I hear about one of these disasters, I become more enraged. Species populations are drastically declining such as the Cerulean Warbler, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is growing in size, and factories are still releasing harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. Even in school, on a much smaller scale, I see students put their bottles into the trash instead of the recycling bin because they cannot be bothered to walk the few extra steps. I have decided to pursue a career in environmental science to help address these issues that only seem to be getting worse. Hopefully, I will be able to make a significant contribution to this worldwide issue. I would like to follow my brother's foot-steps and travel the world to see firsthand how the environment is being affected. For example, visiting the Galapagos Islands and snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef have been lifelong dreams. I would like to learn about how and why coral reefs, the most essential part of the ocean ecosystem, are slowly diminishing. In my future career, I hope to make the environment an issue that everyone is concerned about. Today, people seem to think it is a problem for the future generations; I see trucks that guzzle gas, trash thrown from car windows, and water left running much longer than necessary. Even corporations pollute the environment with the knowledge of the devastating effects it can result in; for instance, I recently received a cell-phone in packaging large enough for a laptop. Through my experiences, I have come to the realization that not one person or agency can completely change the way humans interact with their environment, it needs to be a collaborative effort. My goal is to learn how to best raise awareness about environmental abuses and to learn how to encourage humankind to eliminate their destructive footprints before it's too late. The most beautiful parts of the Earth are the ones not altered by humans. I hope to help create a world where all cherish the environment and its natural beauty. I hope to see students reusing water bottles, children admiring crabs instead of tearing their claws off, and companies thinking about the environment before thinking about their profits. Nature is my passion, and I hope that my children and the future generations are able to see and enjoy its beauty. I hope that one day I can restore the creek to its natural beauty and begin to end this war we've been waging against our environment."
"Every generation suffers through specific tribulations that they are forced to overcome. We have made substantial strides to improve society; however, we still have a long way to go. Although African Americans supposedly have equal rights due to the Civil Rights Act, there are still steps that need to be taken to create racial equality. In this country, many African Americans are raised in poor socioeconomic environments. As a result, they're plagued by unfavorable circumstances throughout their youth making it extremely difficult for them to escape their environment. Playing basketball with inner-city minorities, I've experienced first-hand how easy it is for them to take the wrong path resorting to drugs and violence; children with good hearts and high aspirations are falling victims to their circumstances. Therefore, to create racial equality, our generation needs to provide more opportunities for inner-city minorities to escape their situation and break this seemingly endless cycle."
"Many people relate school and learning to simply the grades on a transcript. Even though I am motivated to achieve the highest grades possible and create my best-self, it is not the sole driving factor behind my motivation to learn. My motivation stems from much more than that; it comes from my vision of what I can accomplish with the information I attain. Many people say ""knowledge is power"" without understanding the truth behind it. With the proper knowledge, one has the ability to chase their dreams and change the world. For me, this means addressing climate change, decreasing pollution, protecting endangered species, and ultimately, creating an environment free from anthropogenic threats. Therefore, my motivation to learn cultivates from my visions and aspirations for my future when I will hopefully be able to make a difference in an essential issue close to my heart."
"""Do you hear that?"" ""Yeah, that must be Sydney."" Since elementary school, I've not only laughed hundreds of times more than the average person, but my laugh has also been called many things like a dolphin call, a seal bark, and an opera note. Soon enough, I realized that the ubiquity and volume of my laugh and upbeat sense of humor had the power to break awkward silences and ease intense moments when appropriate. It was easy to share jokes with people all over campus, whether it was with Sandra who cleaned the bathrooms, my friends during lunchtime, or while visiting Mr. Bennett, the principal. This changed when I went to boarding school. The lack of familiarity scared me. My conversations with classmates, teachers, dorm residents, and custodians all seemed superficial. I thought it was my fault because of my cultural background, my accent and especially my laugh. Because I felt I wasn't connecting with anyone, I repressed my laughter, leaving it to only pedestrian conversation to make connections. No one knew the real laugh, the real me. ""Hey Maddie! How was Chemistry class?"" ""Good, how was Biology?"" The summer after my first year at boarding school, I went on a cultural immersion trip to France and stayed with a host family, the Curis. I was excited to finally speak French every day and embrace French culture. The second day, I explored a small goat cheese farm and learned about the process of making cheese. So at dinner, as I sat around the table with Claire and Francois and their kids Timothee, Marie Liesse, I tried to explain cheese making. I said, ""Le lait de chevres fait le fromage."" Claire responded, ""Je ne comprends pas. Repete s'il te plait."" I used hand gestures and tried different words but still they couldn't understand me. It seemed my Jamaican accent had overshadowed my French accent. When I stopped speaking, I noticed their confused expressions. Claire sensed the awkwardness and smoothly changed the topic. We started to talk about le Mont Saint Michel and Francois said, ""C'est entoure de sable,"" but I couldn't understand. He repeated many times. I sat there, looking puzzled, wondering, ""what could this possibly mean?"" They started to stare at each other, with a ""how else can we explain this?"" look. Claire was about to explain, when Timothee screamed in his best English, ""IT IS SURROUNDED BY SAND!"" Everyone went silent, looking at each other. I thought he must think I'm an idiot! And for the first time in many months, my most genuine, dolphin call laugh was revealed. I could not believe that I hadn't understood that! But what I really couldn't believe was that I laughed so hard. It was a huge relief. The Curis were so surprised by my laugh that they all started to laugh as well. They had never heard a laugh like mine. This moment felt like deja vu. It was a moment I could've had a long time ago, which might have changed the experience I had my sophomore year, but especially a moment that reminded me of something. Everyone has their own ways of connecting with people around the world, and my way was through genuine laughter and humor. When I returned for my junior year at Deerfield, I vowed to never hide myself, and in turn, boarding school became easier (other than the late night papers, projects, and tests, of course). I laughed all the time, maybe as much as before - too much. I laughed with Saba, the exchange student from Jordan during dorm feeds and extra-help. I laughed with my friends in the dining hall where the cooks would tell me when I cleared my plate, ""Sydney, we heard you laughing again!"" And soon enough, they weren't the only ones. Finally, I could see people turning their heads again. ""Do you hear that?"" ""Yeah, that must be Sydney."""
"Food security is a serious issue, and I believe that a significant majority of people do not realize the role agriculture plays in producing food and income for developing countries, in particular. Therefore, instead of focusing on increasing the productivity of their agriculture, countries continue to depend on international trade for food security. This system will prove to be ineffective as the population increases. We need to collectively focus on creating more sustainable methods of providing food for people through sustainable food production and development. We can only do this with the help of effective governments, non-profit organizations, and farmers. In general, the mindset of people needs to be changed. My goal is to use my education at Emory to propel me to be an agent of change."
"The more I delve into a topic - whether it is in science, philosophy, English, psychology or history, and think about the many facets of that topic, I realize how these areas truly overlap. This idea prompts me to accept and challenge different perspectives. It has forced me to question everything, and to think about ideas and concepts more deeply. And to this day, this curiosity hasn't faded. As I get older, my opinions become more broad, and so do my classes. As such, things keep getting ""blurrier."" I'm diving into topics that sometimes, even presently, don't have an answer and introduce new questions. But as I wade through the knowledge, I continue to grow more equipped to define my own outlook."
"The eyes of thousands are on me, watching my every move, as I stand completely paralyzed in front of all my peers and teachers. My heart pounds as I try to calm my nerves and look less freaked out. My mind races with thoughts of how to proceed, but on the outside I keep smiling and remain frozen in place. I know this sounds like an embarrassing nightmare, but unfortunately this was a real life experience. I was performing with my dance team at our school pep rally, and due to technical difficulties, my team and I were left standing on the floor, anxiously awaiting the familiar sound of the music so we could start the routine. The teacher/DJ sprinted to the center of the gym floor and frantically asked my co-captain and me for help with the music. We were shell-shocked, our lack of preparation for this particular situation rendering us completely useless, despite desperately wanting to help remedy the problem. Still frozen in our beginning pose, I waited for the teacher to find a solution. I considered that we might have to exit the floor without the chance to perform the dance I had choreographed and rehearsed for over a month. As the newly appointed co-captain, this was not the way I envisioned the first performance of the season to go. All the hours of mixing the music, working with the team to improve our technique, and coordinating uniforms had led to this moment. I had just 2 minutes and 45 seconds to prove myself and my team and dazzle the audience. Suddenly, I heard the music blasting out of the loudspeaker. We began our dance, and the worry rushed out of my head ... for a millisecond. I quickly realized what was playing was not the actual music, but a recording of one of our practices. It was far too soft, so the entire dance was a train wreck. We couldn't hear the music well enough to move our bodies in synchrony. I struggled to continue the routine, disregarding the music malfunction as I told myself ""just keep dancing."" Afterward, the team felt that they had wasted all the time they had put in. There were tears, and a lot of blaming. I, however, had only one thing on my mind: ""It's not over yet."" We would give one more performance of the dance later that night at the football game, and we had a chance to redeem ourselves and to perform as the team we had been working hard to be. I knew what I had to do and quickly grouped the team into a huddle. I explained that I understood their anger and frustration, but we had an opportunity come back from this disappointment. We had to keep dancing through all craziness, fear, and frustration, because we had worked too hard to give up. We practiced the dance all afternoon, and our frustration started to turn into humorous recounts of the embarrassment. We ran out onto the football field that night, and I tried to ease my nerves as I hit my opening pose, ready to show the entire school community my best work. The music started, and what followed was one of the best performances I could have given, with fully functioning music and a supportive crowd. I left the field elated. There's no better feeling than giving a performance that you know is your best. The team relished the awesome rush of adrenaline, combined with relief that all our hard work was reflected in our dancing. Time and time again I'm surprised by what life throws my way, and I've learned that if I just keep dancing through it, hard work and determination will prevail."
"Global warming is the most critical issue facing my generation. The steady rise of temperatures since the industrial revolution is a major threat to the long-term health of our planet and its many ecosystems. I believe that a foremost concern of young people coming of age in the next 10 years should be combatting climate change by uniting in practicing sustainable business, and finding ways to make daily activities and economic necessities more environmentally friendly. This is why I am so excited about the Goizueta Business School's concentration in Environment and Sustainability Management. The program will expand my knowledge of this subject, combining my interests in environmental science and business to find real world solutions. This will allow me to make an impact in the field and contribute to the efforts to solve this pressing issue."
"Interstellar is a gripping movie that accurately portrays fascinating theoretical physics concepts. The movie deals with a future earth ravaged by climate catastrophe, and an action-packed space mission to another galaxy to find a new home. The effects of the theory of relativity, the singularity of black holes, and even the theoretic Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is just a fancy name for a wormhole, are demonstrated in the film. Since physicist Kip Thorne consulted on the movie, its portrayal of the theory of relativity and other astro-physics concepts are backed by the research and expertise of one of the world's most foremost experts, making it even more compelling. I've seen the movie multiple times, and every time I am captivated by the nuances of the scientific concepts, and I end up exploring a new aspect of physics or astronomy."
"I feel the bead of sweat trickling down my brow as I hesitantly make my way to the stage. My hand trembles as I grab the microphone and I think, almost aloud, ""Why now? Why here? What was I thinking?"" Usually the one to shy away from attention and the spotlight, I can feel the strong gaze of a hundred-odd pair of eyes staring back at me from the audience. The crescendo of the instrumental rises, signaling my turn, and I realize: ""This is it! I have to rap!"" That memory is still fresh in my mind. I was a sophomore rap debutant, attempting to pull off my first vocal performance. Rap, in my opinion, is one of the most lyrically expressive genres of music, tackling a plethora of topics, from societal issues to love and emotion. I am intrigued by its versatility and ability to paint a detailed picture in my mind. I began my freshman year high school in a completely new environment, having to make new friends amongst other freshmen who knew each other for many years prior to my arrival. Being introverted did not help either. One day something amazing happened at Jazz Band practice, a scene only portrayed in movies. A classmate began playing one of my favorite rap songs on the piano and another began singing its lyrics. Instinctively, I began to play the drums to the beat and joined them. This class was not only the foundation of my rap group but helped foster important friendships. From that day, we spent hours discussing our favorite songs and analyzing both mainstream and underground rappers. Often, our discussions would be intense. I would favor Logic as the best rapper in modern music, whereas one of my friends would argue that Kendrick Lamar was the most talented. During one such discussion, one of my group mates posed an idea: why not perform our favorite songs in front of our friends? Of course, I resisted. After much coaxing, I agreed to play the drums in the background during the performance. Our debut performance was met with a standing ovation. Even as my friends cheered us, I felt I deserved none of it. I felt separated from my group, being the only one of us not rapping. Right then, I let my group know that I was going to rap at our next show. I came up with the idea of a concert fundraiser that would deliver all the proceeds to charity. We decided on a list of songs. Then, I spent days memorizing my lines and practicing them until they were perfect. Eventually, we were ready to perform. That evening, as the first instrumental began, I expectantly waited for my verse. The audience swayed to the beat of the music, and I grew calmer watching them. I began rapping and my friends in the audience began cheering my name. The song ended too soon for me. This time I felt I had earned the applause that followed. As we performed more often, my performance skills improved. I had progressed to incorporating more movement, defining my presence while performing on stage. As the audience participated more, my rapping became more enjoyable and I learned that being a good performer was more than being a ""good rapper"". It was making the audience feel as if they were a part of our group and included in what we were feeling. Rapping helped augment my sense of empathy and understanding of others' sentiments. The connection a performer forms with the audience can only be experienced and I have begun to appreciate and enjoy this state of mind. Rapping helped me emerge out of my introverted self."
"Of all works, William Blake's poem, ""Ecchoing Green"", is my favorite. It explores the idea that only youth is vibrant and as old age ensues, one's ""Ecchoing Green"", the period of vitality, will darken. As a high school student, I comprehend the poem's sentiments and can relate to it. To me, it is a cautionary means to always remind myself to make the best use of my time to avoid regrets. It motivates me to strive for my goals and to never stop working to achieve them. The poem encourages me to make my life a period of an ""Ecchoing Green"", to always have my accomplishments ""eccho"" rather than have my failures haunt me."
"""The key is not the 'will to win'... everybody has that. It is the will to prepare to win that is important"" - Bob Knight I would like to approach my years at college like a basketball game. As a freshman, I would run a flex offense by exploring multiple disciplines to define my academic track. I would major in Physics or Anthropology and have access to world-class facilities like the School of Medicine. In subsequent years, I will employ a fast-break offense, focusing on an interdisciplinary track which blends education, research, and engagement. Also, I would participate in programs beyond general academia to connect with leaders from different fields and communities. As an Emory senior, I will be able to run any offense given my diverse experience. I will have prepared for medical school, engaged with exceptional people, and cheered for soccer and basketball team as a proud Eagle."
"Court 17 at the U.S. Open Tennis Championships is packed with cheering fans. Lights are blazing, and TV cameras are everywhere. Marin Cilic, the 2014 Champion, sets up not ten feet away from me on the court. Nearly a minute later, he finishes the point with a dropshot and tilts his racquet toward the corner of the court. I bolt for his sweaty towel, opening it just enough for him to easily grab it and wipe his face. I set the balls on the surface of his racquet, and he hands me back the towel. After returning it to the corner of the court, I resume my spot between the JP Morgan logo and the giant digital clock, scrutinizing Cilic's every move. Aware a mistake could land me on Sportscenter's Not Top 10, I push through the heat, hustling after every loose ball, and soon, it's match point for Cilic. As his opponent double-faults to lose the match, I notice kids running down courtside for autographs. That was me once, eagerly crowding in with my oversized Wilson tennis ball covered in signatures. The only spot closer to the action was on the court, so two years ago, I became an official U.S. Open ballboy. Ball ""boys,"" who range in age from 14 to 65, work hard. In high-pressure situations, you never take your eyes off the player. The signal to bounce him balls during his service game is as subtle as eye contact, and a demand for his towel as small as a flick of his racquet. What makes a ballboy stand out is his understanding of player habits, yet players never thank us, because nothing can matter more to them than their individual careers. It's about being taken seriously: the same player protocol dictates they not show umpires too much respect, either. While we may all look alike in our matching Ralph Lauren uniforms, there is actually a hierarchy of ballboys. At the bottom is an abundance of new ballboys, eagerly attempting to rise to the top and earn the same privileges as the few ""super-veteran"" ballboys, which can include daily appearances at Arthur Ashe Stadium. But new ballboys cannot simply invert this social pyramid and climb straight to the top, so the hierarchy tests their discipline. Evaluators will release a ballboy for underperformance at any time, and every year some simply don't survive past the qualifying tournament. I remember the shock on one ballboy's face as he was released for asking a player to follow him on Twitter, a naive mistake by a kid overwhelmed by excitement. I have a lot of empathy for them. I see these new ballboys working harder on court to prove themselves, and it's difficult being critical of them. As a second-year ballboy, I was sometimes named crew chief, the one ballboy on court responsible for reporting to supervisors after a 2-hour shift, and I sometimes saw myself inadvertently disheartening this bottom tier of ballboys more than morally lifting them. It's hard, balancing fun with responsibility while navigating the hierarchy. But that's what defines a ballboy, and holding myself and my crew to high standards helps us all succeed. I want my supervisors to see I'm engaged and professional, not idly letting things slide. We all want to be chosen for that Roger Federer night session match, and that doesn't happen being sloppy. Being a ballboy brings you right into the action, to the thrill of jogging out of the players' tunnel under the bright lights and getting paid to watch tennis from the best seat in the house. But it also makes you part of a community. Once a year, united by our love of tennis, we put our outside lives as students, businessmen, combat veterans, and everything in between on hold to come together and be part of one of the game's greatest tournaments. I wouldn't trade it for anything."
"I am most excited about the increased independence that I will have, particularly in my academic life. In a rigid high school curriculum, I seldom have the chance to pick from a wide variety of subjects I care about, as I'll be able to in college. Particularly with my interests in music and business, college will offer me more than just the one business class or the one ensemble that I am currently limited to, and I think that exploring connections between the things I study will help me get even more out of my education. I know there will only be so much room in my schedule, but those decisions will be mine to make. I look forward to having this greater sense of responsibility and learning how to manage my schedule around the many things my college experience will have to offer."
"The classroom environment provides a great safety net for building the fearlessness to pursue any project, and I think that even failure will only teach me more for the future. I want my classmates to be ambitious people, risk-takers and experimenters who aren't afraid to make mistakes, but I also want an environment that emphasizes collaboration over competition. Beyond that, because I plan to study business, I think that a city with a thriving corporate community would provide opportunities to experience real-life business beyond the bubble of a classroom. Ultimately, I'm looking for a close-knit, enthusiastic, engaged community that cheers at least as hard for intellectual achievements as for the successes of its sports teams. In a place like that, I know I will have not only the best academic preparation but also the support of a diverse alumni community as I start my professional career."
"Anxiety. Stress. Decisions. Change. All of these words accurately describe my senior year thus far; and as I go through this application process, I am faced with the same recurring question, ""What do I want to do with the rest of my life?"" If someone would have asked me this when I was 4, I would have said that I wanted to play for the rest of my life, and if they would have asked me again at 15, I would have said that I wanted to sleep for the rest of my life. Before I knew it, I was thrust into adulthood and faced with a staggering amount of decisions to make. I soon realized that the time for playing and wasting the day away in bed was over. If I am being completely honest, the last time I remember being one-hundred percent sure of myself in regards to my future is last year at around this time. I had a plan: I was going to study Pre-Physical Therapy-I chose Physical Therapy because I loved working with people, mainly children-at Emory, then I would attend University of Southern California's graduate program for Kinesiology. Finally, I was going to move back to Georgia to complete my residency, and also so that I could be closer to my parents. Suddenly, my world was flipped on its head after I shadowed an actual physical therapist and realized that I did not want to be a PT at all. To say the least, I was shook. I felt like my life was not progressing, as if I was in free fall. I had built my entire future around this idea that I wanted to have a career in physical therapy, so when that idea disappeared my entire future came crashing down around me. This past summer, my family and I took a trip to visit my brother and sisters. While we were there, we stayed with my cousin who was a certified registered nurse anesthetist, or CRNA. As he told me about his job, I became increasingly more interested in the field. I began researching and talking to other CRNAs, and eventually I decided to look into it as a future career for myself. The more I researched, the more I could see myself pursuing a career as a nurse anesthetist. I mapped out my plans for college, and became more serious in moving forward with these plans. Before long the fragments of my broken future were coming back together again. As of today, my ultimate goal is still to become a CRNA, or work somewhere in the medical field because that is what I am the most interested in, and where I feel I would do the most service. The last step in my college preparation process is to shadow someone in my field of interest. I am somewhat apprehensive because of my last shadowing experience, but I am a different person than who I was two years ago. If my plans fall through this time, my whole future will not fall apart because I have learned that my future is undefined. My future is affected by my mentality and my decisions, but it is not defined by these things. This perspective has helped me overcome many obstacles, and it has proven that when you approach life with a positive outlook you can only succeed. I have been told that my tenacity and indomitable spirit will get me far in life, but these characteristics can only get me so far. I truly believe that my character is what will take me that extra mile. My discipline, dedication, integrity, and trustworthiness is what I believe makes me stand out because that is what the world is lacking right now. Anyone can learn a skill to make money, but fewer and fewer people are learning what it takes to be a good person."
"I believe that I am a part of a vital generation that could make amazing discoveries and advancements, but our potential is counteracted by our lackadaisical disposition. Laziness is one of the biggest problems facing my generation. With the consistent progress of technology, our need and drive to learn new skills is decreasing. The iGeneration is the name that has been assigned to my generation. This name is appropriate because our lives are centered around technology. Nowadays our needs can be met at the click of a button, and this sense of ""easy living"" is becoming increasingly detrimental to the future of our generation. We need to realize that technology is unreliable, and therefore inadequate. As nice as it is to have, we need to learn to fulfill our needs and learn new skills without technology so that we can function and prosper in the future."
"My favorite fictional movie right now is Hacksaw Ridge. I saw this film recently in theaters and absolutely loved it. Hacksaw Ridge is an awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping movie about a young man who's indomitable faith inspires a whole troop of soldiers as he accomplishes the impossible. I am not going to say too much about the plot because I believe that everyone should watch this movie and I do not want to ruin it, but I love this work for many, many reasons. One of the main reasons is: the faith factor. I am a Seventh-Day Adventist, so my beliefs and values is a central part of my life. The fact that Desmond T. Doss, the main protagonist, never went against his beliefs in the face of potential incarceration, and even possible death, inspires me beyond words."
"Fork In The Road It was a crisp morning in northeast Poland. We'd been walking silently for ten minutes in a beautiful forest lost in our thoughts. All I could hear were the cracking of dry twigs, the strange sound jeans make as they rub together, and the distant cry of a bird. The bright blue sky was flaked with puffy white clouds, and the golden rays of sun pierced through the trees. The smell of pine, damp earth, and old leaves invaded my senses. It all seemed so perfect. My blissful daydreaming was interrupted when we hit a fork in the road. Go right and I'd continue through the beautiful forest; left and I'd bear witness to the fate so many of my ancestors met over half a century ago. As I stood waiting for the rest of the group to catch up I couldn't help but think of a favorite poem, ""The Road Not Taken"" by Robert Frost. In that moment standing in the beautiful woods I recognized how fortunate I was. I had reached the point in my life where the choices I made would have an impact on my future. Unlike others who had paused here before me, I had the ability to choose. My parents raised me with opposing philosophies and having to choose between them has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My religious French mother imparted in me a love of Judaism. I went to Jewish schools, observed Shabbat, kept kosher, and enjoyed learning about my religion. My secular American father had other ideas. He taught me to be skeptical and to experience all life had to offer, pushing me to try new things and become a worldly person. At first it was confusing, but as time wore on I better understood the value of what my parents were teaching me and I developed my own way where I incorporated both philosophies. Standing in the beautiful forest I remembered an earlier trip. One of my mother's oldest friends lived in Japan. She invited us to come visit but we always declined. There were many complications. Japan had no kosher food and because of the International Date Line we would need to keep two days of Shabbat. However, we finally gave in and booked a ticket for two weeks. Arriving at Tokyo Airport was like landing in another world. Everything was so different: the writing, the food, people's mannerisms - it was all so wonderfully peculiar. The juxtaposition of custom and innovation, modern and ancient was spectacular. We would walk through the city and see an ancient Buddhist temple next door to a contemporary glass skyscraper. People bowed to one another, and there was deep tradition in even the smallest of tasks. It was wonderful. We spent the first few days miserably living off fruit, crackers, powdered milk and cereal. It was torture walking past all the restaurants and cafes, none of which were kosher. Then I realized that I could experience Japanese cuisine without compromising my beliefs. I explored the Tokyo fish market and bought fresh sushi grade tuna, wasabi, rice, sugar, vinegar and soy sauce and taught myself how to make sushi. Eating homemade traditional Japanese ""kosher"" food I stayed true to my Judaism as my mother taught me, and I ventured out of my Jewish bubble as my father always urged me to do. As I continued along the leaf-strewn path in the Polish woods I realized why I felt so connected to Frost's poem. Just as Frost took the grassy road less traveled, so had I - ""and that has made all the difference."" I am who I am because of the choices I've made based on the philosophies I've been taught. Although on second thought, that's how I was raised; so maybe it never was a choice at all."
"Technological advances change the world. They bring opportunity and make life more comfortable. Already college graduates have trouble finding jobs and I worry about the effect robotics and automation will have. For the past few months I've been interning at an Artificial Intelligence company called Kasisto working on a project aimed at making banking more accessible to everyone. But really, won't it rid the financial industry of tellers, customer service providers, financial advisors and many related jobs? Isn't it happening in other areas - most notably with self-driving cars, which have the potential to lay waste to one of America's largest occupations, driving? How technology affects the world is a consideration that needs to be addressed. And where the new jobs will come from after the old ones have been eliminated is another. If we aren't careful the advances being made will have a significant negative impact on my generation."
"I grew up in a home where everything, and I mean everything, was turned into a learning experience. Dinners were packed with geo-political discussions and history lessons. I often left the table feeling as if my brain had a better meal than my stomach. On road trips my family blasted music and podcasts alike. A playlist might include This American Life followed by Eminem, Bach, Miles Davis, The Beatles, and Radio Lab. We were also encouraged to go outside and be active. I surf, run, ski, play soccer, and kayak. My parents constantly stressed the notion of quality versus quantity and taught us that hard work always paid off. Being raised this way gave me a love and a thirst for knowledge and athletics. Learning comes from everywhere - not just from a classroom, but also from friends, experiences, conversations, and adventures. So, watch out world I'm here to learn!"
"My Evolution I was born in Pakistan to Afghan parents who sought refuge from the Taliban in Afghanistan. I am the youngest of four boys, and did not attend school until my family and I arrived in the United States in 2003. My brothers grew up in a household where education was highly valued. Their experience has shaped my understanding of the importance of completing my education. I began as a kindergartener, and have had opportunities my brothers have not. I have always taken the initiative to improve myself both personally and intellectually. In elementary school, I attempted to teach my class Persian, my native language. I have also participated in helping out at a food bank, and I regard that experience as an important step for me in understanding my role as a citizen of the world. Academically, I always strive to challenge myself. I enrolled in three AP level courses, because I wanted to do more to prepare myself for the rigor of college education. In addition, I have also volunteered at Emory Clinic with the intention of exposing myself to a medical environment as I am interested in pursuing a career in medicine. My desire to pursue a career in medicine stems from my profound interest in science. Being born in a strictly religious culture, I had no appreciation for scientific reasoning. God created the world and humans. But when I entered school in the United States, I found value in the objective evidence science provided towards human evolution. Here was a worldview that required nothing but patient and careful observation and study. What was different about biology and science in general, was that it answered the question how, as opposed to religion. I desire to pursue a career in medicine to unravel the mysteries and the questions I have. Last year, I applied to a college I thought was affordable, in the hope of facing a small amount of debt after college. I was admitted by this college, and later found out that I was not going to receive much financial aid. I was faced with a dilemma because there was no way I was going to be able to attend this college without receiving financial aid. So, I decided to withdraw my application to the college, and take a gap year. During my gap year, I plan to do volunteer work, read voraciously and explore my interest in medicine. I made a choice to apply to this university due to the rigor, excellence, resources, and opportunities I would receive. What stopped me applying to this university before was my fear of facing a large amount of debt. I now realize that if I am going to be faced with a large amount of debt, it would be worth it after going to this college. My motto is that ""you can't put a price on knowledge."" I believe that the security my family and I have enjoyed in the United States has allowed me the relative freedom to aspire to engage in situations and discussions that involve political, social and religious issues. Without fear of persecution, I have learned to confront indoctrination and put value in critical inquiry. My knowledge and my understanding of everything that I know has been the result of determined thinking. I am determined to pursue a bachelor's degree at this institution with the hope of furthering my education by seeking a master's degree. I am one of the first in my family to have the opportunity to attend college, and I am proud of this fact. By attending college, I will realize both my dream and the dreams of my parents who have brought my brothers and me to the United States to have an opportunity to achieve excellence in education, in order to have a life of financial comfort and personal happiness."
"There are numerous reasons for what excites me and what I am looking forward to in my college experience. Many people say that it's the stage of life where you are specifically focusing on your career. I agree with this statement, but I would add that it is also the stage of life to where you are breaking out of your box and being introduced to many new ways of thinking. It is the phase of life where a student's religious, personal and social views change, and they become thinkers and leaders. In conclusion, what excites me most is the opportunity to be a part of this experience."
"Learning is a tool that we have been taught is the key to success. Without learning, we would not be able to correct our mistakes and improve. This applies to school and life. However, this is not from where my fundamental motivation stems. Learning is a tool I utilize to help me gain an understanding of the functions and principles of life. Some people would just learn about the field of study in which they intend to get a job. I disagree with this way of learning because it encourages both disinterest and ignorance about ideas that may have indirect impact in our lives."
"I was never comfortable displaying my emotions. To others, I was introverted. Reticent. Indifferent, even. The emotions I felt, I kept to myself. I knew how I felt; no one else had to know. Except Juno, my rough collie. Juno always waited at the window for me to come home from school. Once I got to the front steps, he'd whine until I greeted him. He knew when I was stressed and would bring me my favorite blanket from my bed, or simply cuddle next to me and sleep until I went to bed. He kept me grounded through the good and the bad. But then, he became the cause of an emotional breakdown. One night during spring break of my junior year, I came home late. Juno, four years old at the time, got up from his bed and started to walk over, but his legs gave out. Laughing, I walked over to pet him, but I noticed tremors. I kneeled down and wrapped my arms around him, until he began coughing. Blood. I yelled downstairs for my mom. We needed to get him to the vet. I carried him out into the car as my mom started the engine. I begged to go with him, but my mom asked me to stay. I knew I couldn't argue with her now-we were just wasting time. I walked back inside, and the first thing I noticed was blood. I grabbed the stain remover. My mom didn't have to return to this sight, these reminders. This wasn't fair-Juno was only four years old. Why wouldn't the stains come out? I wanted to call my mom and ask her to take me with her, but I couldn't bring myself to. Tears rolled down my face. Nothing wrong could happen, I told myself; he'll be back soon. But I should've known when he collapsed in the living room. I shouldn't have gone out today. Whenever I was upset or frustrated and felt alone, he knew and stayed by my side to help me. Now he was hurting, and I couldn't be there for him. I was useless; I couldn't do anything but blot and pray. Once I heard the phone ring, my stomach dropped. I picked up but already knew. All the strength in my body left as I felt the phone slip out of my hands and my knees give out. This couldn't be real... I didn't know what to do. I fought against the tears. This wasn't me-I don't cry. I needed to convince myself to remain strong. School started, but no one had a clue about my feelings. Weeks went by, but I continued to look at pictures of Juno, continued to feel numb. I tried to push away the curiosity about what happened because I knew I couldn't ask without crying. All the guilt, emptiness-it hurt too much, but I needed to know. I got home one day and went straight to my mom's office. She re-lived every moment and showed me the veterinarian's notes. I started crying, but for once, I didn't care. My mom had recorded the veterinarian explaining Juno's death, and she played this as she held me close, crying with me. This felt like first time she ever physically comforted me, the first time we were both vulnerable and open to each other. Although I still feel uncomfortable sharing my emotions, I now do a better job of letting myself express them. I can laugh and be happy when I want to, and I can be upset, even vulnerable, when I need to. My closest friends now see me cry when I'm upset, and I let them comfort me. Whenever I open myself up to others, I always remember Juno. He was only here for a short time, but he'll always be in my heart."
"According to the United Nations, the world population is expected to reach 10.4 billion in 2067, three billion more people than we have today, including the 800 million we are currently unable to feed. Without decisive action, the number of people struggling with insufficient food resources will only increase, a situation that demands a more secure food supply. Such an outcome will be achievable through an in-depth understanding of the causes of food insecurity. I believe updating electronic ear tags to store up-to-date information on animals' health and location histories would be effective in allowing traceability and prevention of the further spread of foreign animal diseases. If shown to improve food security, I hope to develop and modify the ear tags and associated technologies to ensure that not only those in first world countries but also those in the rest of the world will have access to healthy, plentiful food."
"Invited to Intelsat's EpicNG Satellite Launching Ceremony, I stood anxiously while everyone counted down with the screen. As an engineer stood beside me, explaining every step and his responsibilities in developing channelizer technology, which uses sub-beams rather than traditional wide-beams, I began wanting my own hands-on experience. He suggested that I try using a Raspberry Pi, and I explored its coding capabilities while developing a devotion for solving problems. Everything we now know has been derived from a problem. Isaac Newton questioned what force of nature caused an apple to fall from rest before identifying it as ""gravity""-the understanding of this force on all of Earth's objects led to his three Laws of Motion. Learning is not the mere memorization of facts, but rather the comprehensive understanding of solutions. I am motivated to understand these already-found solutions and find connections between them to create solutions of my own."
"The thought of writing this essay made me want to curl and hide under my bed rather than sit in front of my computer and tell my story. But then I realized that I had a remarkable story. I have moved away from my home country, moved back to it, and then even to an entirely different country. The crucial thing that moving has taught me is flexibility and independence. I moved to Brazil when I was in 9th grade. I am Brazilian by birth, but I moved to the U.S. when I was one; my childhood was American. I was thirteen when we moved back to Brazil. When my parents told me we were moving back to Brazil, I threw a tantrum like a three-year-old screeching for ice cream. I despised the thought of leaving my pre-established life in Pembroke Pines. There, everything was studiously designed to avoid flaws. I had a comfortable life. I played various sports and had made great friends. Moving would mean losing everything I had: my friends, my life. The idea of moving truly terrified me. After that initial fear, though, I finally realized how privileged I was to being able to move to another culture at such a young age. I moved to Curitiba, a city in the south of Brazil. It was full-on culture shock-the streets were filled with people begging for money. Nevertheless, it was also full of life. People would stop and talk to each other. The scene was beautiful to me. Brazil had something I had not experienced in my small American town; it had diversity. No two houses were the same. Yet, despite holding Brazilian citizenship, I was a tourist in this country. At first, this segregation upset me; I did not want to be considered a gringa. I would speak Portuguese and people would respond in English, assuming I was not Brazilian. It made it hard for me to truly fit in. So, for a time, I actually succumbed to that treatment; if others saw me as an American, then I was an American. But all the while, that longing to belong grew. Eventually, after making great friends, I began to become integrated into my heritage. After I moved, many doors opened for me. I would never again be content to stay put. I dreamed of moving to Japan, to Australia, to Spain. In my senior year of high school, everyone was applying to universities. I felt detached. I had made my decision to take a gap year; I wanted to mature more. Yet, it made me nervous seeing everyone already have a set path for the next couple years, while I was still ""in limbo."" By moving to Spain for my gap year, I learned the value of appreciating myself. I went alone to a country where I did not even speak the language. It was a feeling of solitude I had never felt before, and I only had myself to go to for comfort. I would spend hours, lunches, and nights alone. This homesickness lasted for some time. As time passed, though, I got to know myself; independence changed me. I ended up making German, Chinese, and Spanish friends. I learned about entirely different cultures. I learned many valuable lessons from moving. I learned not to fear the unknown, or starting something new. The unfamiliar might lurk in the background, but I can learn something from it. I have learned to accept the past as the past, as something that has already shaped me, and instead allow new things to influence me. Change does not mean mourning what you will lose, but rather embracing what you will gain. All in all, I went from a culture of handshakes to one with one kiss on a cheek, to another with two kisses, and I adapted to them all."
"Overdependence on technology will be a future challenge for us. This goes beyond the suspicions and theories of robots controlling us and big technological black holes; dependence will have an impact on my generation. I have always had my doubts about whether robots would be able to have something comparable to human intelligence; after all, this is a very broad topic that includes various subjects. I am certain, however, that the influence of technology will continue to grow, as will our dependence on it. GPS has made human reasoning relying on maps obsolete. FaceTime has removed the need for face-to-face interaction. Technology, of course, has made positive impacts on us as well. It has facilitated the acquisition of knowledge and expanded human interaction on a global scale, for instance. Yet I fear that this access to technology could make many people indifferent and passive. Moderation is key to everything."
"Competition drives me to continue learning, but not in the sense of being better than anyone else. Instead, I push myself to learn the most I can in this lifetime. I know that I am the only one that will get me anywhere, and that only I can push myself to be my very best. I once had a math teacher who would often receive the standard high school freshman complaint of not wanting to do their math homework. In response, thought she would tell us to ""do what you believe you should do. Your future is in your hands."" I would work harder after hearing that. All the effort I put in was for myself only, and I wouldn't want to disappoint myself. I now continuously keep myself updated on world politics, or the latest inventions, because I do not want to slow myself down."
"The auditorium swarmed with 1,500 students. I nervously trembled in front of the crowd, hands in my pockets-this was my first time speaking in front of a large audience. ""...And remember, a vote for Kris is a vote for urinal walls!"" I concluded enthusiastically, my voice projecting towards my fellow classmates. I heard laughs echo from the crowd. My school did not have walls between urinals in the men's bathrooms, an issue I wanted to address in a humorous yet serious way. It took me a minute to realize that the students were not laughing with me, but rather at me. I stood there, embarrassed. The class gazed upon my equation for Planck's constant, knowing full well that I was wrong. ""...Kris, give the marker to Kevin,"" my physics teacher stated with a disappointed tone. I sank into my seat, ashamed. My friends giggled as I touched the wall of the pool a full 30 seconds after the last person. My goggles had filled with water when I jumped into the pool, causing me to bounce between the lane ropes as if I were an excited kangaroo. I tossed my useless goggles towards my bag; I was humiliated. For 17 years, my life felt like an endless loop of failures. I only wanted to proudly represent my school, but my execution was faulty and my reputation was non-existent. Soon, however, I would use the lessons from these failures to help me in my next challenge. Campaign season began again. This time, I was running for a different position: Student Body President. Given my track record, this would be an uphill battle from the beginning. Despite my failures throughout high school, however, I did not let my past discourage me. In fact, rather than holding me back, reflecting on my disappointments in the auditorium, the aquatic center, and the classroom inspired me to push on. Yes, I had failed in the pool, but I never gave up. I knew I could do the same this time too. I would not drop out of the race; instead, I would take action. The opportunity to change my school for the better-to transform the experiences of current and future students-fueled me to persevere despite my uncertainties and hesitations. With this new mindset in place, I assembled my platform. I spent countless hours making posters and flyers, but I knew it wouldn't be enough; I had to get more personal. I must have talked to over 100 students individually, explaining my platform and asking about changes they wanted to see at the school: a career-fair, another school dance, a more connected student body. It wasn't until my campaign that I realized how many students had such great ideas; meeting new people rekindled the burning passion I had for my school. The results came out during lunch. ""After tallying up the votes, congratulations are in store for Kris Chellani, YOUR NEW STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT!"" My heart pounded with exhilaration. All of the challenges and trepidations I faced led to my proudest accomplishment. I was so excited about the changes I could start making - a career fair? A more united student body? I dove right in. The auditorium swarmed with 500 new students; it was freshman orientation. As I held the microphone, I saw myself being laughed at a year earlier in the same exact spot, and smiled proudly. My life was not an exercise of failure, but rather an exercise of making sure those same failures wouldn't be repeated. I stood in front of the crowd, hands cheerfully on my hips. ""Welcome to Chapel Hill High School. My name is Kris Chellani, and I am your Student Body President!"""
"Although new advancements in science and medicine are uncovered every day, scientists have yet to find a solution for neonatal malnutrition. Malnutrition is the leading cause of neonatal death, and according to the World Health Organization, it is the cause of 45 percent of all child deaths. As an intern at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, I had the opportunity to study neonatal malnutrition in depth. I focused my research on the efficiency of Gastrointestinal tubes (G-tubes), which are only placed in infants at a very low weight. I worked with a team to assess if G-tubes were successful in allowing premature infants to gain weight appropriately. The data proved that G-tubes were unsuccessful; malnutrition is a hard problem to tackle, and this study only proved how difficult it is to solve, which is why it is likely to still be a challenge in the next 50 years."
"As an aspiring doctor, one book that I have especially enjoyed reading is The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. This book is about the life of a poor farmer, whose cells-taken without her knowledge or permission-became one of the most central tools in medicine, essential in the development of the polio vaccine and cancer research. Lack's cells, now known as HeLa cells, were used to create an immortal cell line for scientific experimentation. Many ethical issues were raised concerning the exploitation of her cells; it was interesting to read about how even though her cells were exploited by billions of people, she remained unknown and her family remained in poverty. This book gave me the great opportunity to learn about the overlay of medicine, ethics, and race, medicine in the 1950's and how it influenced the field of medical ethics at present."
"Xiao Mei held my hand as we walked through the gloomy, cavernous parking garage. Finally, we found the elevator. The man standing next to us had already pressed the button. He looked at me and then back at Xiao Mei. ""Ni de ba ba shi Xinjiang ren ma? (Is your Dad from Xinjiang?),"" he asked Xiao Mei through a thick Hunan accent. She stared up at me, confused. I wasn't sure what he was asking either. Then it hit me. ""Wo bu shi ta de baba (I'm not her Dad),"" I said laughing, ""Wo ye bu shi Xinjiang ren (And I'm not from Xinjiang either)"". I'm an Australian-American, I have short, dark curly hair, I'm fair-skinned and I wear a Star of David around my neck, but, somehow, a Chinese man had mistaken me for being Chinese. In San Francisco, I attended a Mandarin immersion school and we had a Shanghainese nanny. Later, my family moved back to Singapore, a primarily Chinese-ethnic country. Despite having no Chinese heritage, I've come to feel a certain connection to China and its culture. It is this tie that made me feel as though I ""belonged"" when that man asked if I was Chinese. Yet, of the two passports I carry, neither is from China. I went to an American school in Singapore, I have lived in the US and my grandparents are there. But the thing that truly connects me to the US is baseball. I fall asleep reading articles on www.baseballreference.com under my Mets comforter. I used to get up at the crack of dawn in Singapore to watch the Mets play, as David Wright's Fathead watched over me. I lived on the other side of the world, but my passion for the sport propelled me to sacrifice sleep for the sheer spectacle of a baseball game. This is what helped me retain my sense of being American. No matter what, I'll always feel at home in the US. My parents made sure my brother and I were bilingual. While I resented the move to Singapore, I thought it would help develop my Mandarin. Little did I realize that it would strengthen my sense of Jewish identity. While going to synagogue was a weekly event in San Francisco, I never felt a true connection to Judaism. It wasn't until we moved that I encountered anti-Semitism. It had never been an issue before. At Singapore American School, I was one of three Jews in our 300-person class. My first week as a 5th grader, I remember being called a ""sneaky Jew"". Kids threw coins at me with hopes that I'd pick them up like a ""typical Jew"". I found myself speaking up. For the first time in my life, I experienced a truly powerful bond to Judaism when I realized how much I felt compelled to defend my heritage. My Dad's from Perth, I'm an Australian citizen, and half of my family lives ""down under"", but I don't really associate with being Australian. It's just something that's always been part of me. However, I am Australian in my love of the outdoors, sports, sun and the beach. Whenever there's an international sporting event, I find myself supporting Australia as if I've lived there my entire life. ""Home, we know"", as Pico Iyer says, ""is not just the place where you happen to be born. It's the place where you become yourself."" When I was six, someone asked me where I was from. ""I'm half-Chinese, half-American, half-Jewish and half-Australian,"" I told her proudly. My Mom told me that she was worried about my math but loved my world-view. Indeed, I am a sort of ""globo sapien"" who belongs nowhere, but is home everywhere."
"The significant challenges facing our generation include insufficient food and water, religious intolerance and rising inequality. On a different level, an issue of real importance to me is the increasing depersonalization of human interaction. It seems cliche, but I believe humans need to engage deeply with one another to foster fulfilling relationships, develop creative ideas and better manage our planet. Device usage is a barrier to the advancement of the human condition. There's no way to truly connect with someone unless you're fully immersed in a conversation. Yet, I often see people who are together, but engrossed with their devices. I know I'm not the only one who detests this; there is even a start-up which makes lockable pouches for devices in order to create phone-free spaces. Personally, I try to ensure real human connection by asking people to put their phones away whenever we get together."
"For many people, Moneyball, by Michael Lewis, delivered new insight into how statistics can be used to generate competitive advantage in baseball. This is something I already knew from poring over statistics and reading articles on sites like FanGraphs.com throughout my childhood. But I still count Moneyball as my favorite book because it inspired me to conduct my own research into predictors of outcomes in baseball. In Moneyball, general manager Billy Beane acquires good players less expensively by moving to evaluation using on-base percentage (OBP) instead of batting average (AVG). In my case, using baseballsavant.mlb.com Statcast data, I created a plot showing the negative correlation between perceived velocity and batting average against fastballs. My finding can help teams better evaluate pitchers. Moneyball even stimulated my thinking about careers; I'm currently exploring the sports tech industry by compiling Minor League player data at Sportvision."
"Crosstown Traffic (With a Most Humble Nod to Mr. Jimi Hendrix) What is the deal with the US-101 / I-405 interchange anyway? Whoever got paid to determine that two perpendicular highways ought to both be labeled as running north / south should maybe consider a geography class, or a geometry class, or probably both. I make the ever-grueling journey across what is widely labeled the worst traffic trap on the globe: where the 101 meets the 405 and all of Los Angeles bends to the will of ruby-red brakelights. Stalking and crouching and stalking and crouching, us commuters sit. Waiting. However, I cannot help but reconcile with my commute: I have accepted it. In such a decentralized city, the lack of proper public transportation proves a bitter irony; so, inherently my progression from riding the bus to and from school to enduring the freeway has been a momentous change. A change riddled with the reminder of adulthood coming twice daily: the thronging hours of the early morning and the rush hour of the late afternoon. Yet that's not everything. I accept my commute for other reasons as well; because, to me the freeway has become a sort of classroom. Two extra hours of the school day that I wouldn't dare waste. Some days I'll listen to podcasts. Stuff You Should Know, 99 Percent Invisible, Malcolm Gladwell's Revisionist History among other favorites. Others are more pressing, more active. To study for a difficult Latin test, or to nail down my lines for a production, I'll simply read whatever piece of text I'm working with, be it a script or an ancient carmina from right under the steering wheel and hope other cars avoid me. Just kidding! What I'll actually do is rely on the voice memo function of my cell phone to pre-recite content and then listen to in the car. While I hate to desecrate the speakers in my-as in my generous parents'-car with the sound of my voice, I cannot help but recognize the process as integral to my classroom car. And still, when I am plagued by the most pressing days, I simply default to music. Yet, like podcasts and voice memos I try my best to engage with what I'm listening to. I cannot allow myself to passively listen on, an important distinction I make everyday. That is why it fascinates me to notice the slight connections between genres of music, to listen for sampling. Sampling is like a kind wave across lanes on the freeway: no one is kind on the freeway so when you hear a classic rock guitar riff from the seventies pop up in an eighties rap song you turn your head. In other words, when someone does show you kindness on the road it is, in fact, head turning. Listen to the Beastie Boys' ""She's Crafty"" and Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks."" Within the first thirty seconds of each is where my seminal crave for music lies. But there are still other days where I drift dangerously close to the omnipresent passive drive. What is the point? I wonder almost every time I stumble into traffic. ""The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing comes in (David Foster Wallace, This is Water)."" I make an important choice every time I drive in traffic. I could let the north / south misnomer bother me. I could allow the futility of driving in traffic envelop my whole life outlook. But instead I actively engage with the content around me. Podcasts, voice memos, music, the greater world around me. Perhaps it's all a distraction I've created. An illusion just to make the bitter pill of traffic more easy to swallow. But, perhaps what I choose to accomplish in traffic does indeed allow me a more positive outlook. Or perhaps I'm just overthinking all of this."
"""I am you and what I see is me,"" a line from Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"" which embodies a challenge that we face now and will continue to face for the next 50 years if nothing is done: communities have become echo chambers. Communities have become echo chambers and often cast out differing ideas and opinions. This is not political. This is not a liberal problem, this is not a conservative problem. This is a people problem. And it's ironic because people problems are usually the simplest problems. A four-year-old could better solve them than an adult. Perhaps the ""wisdom of age"" - judgement - inhibits an adult from seeing the plain truth like a child; so, in my quickly fleeting in between - adolescence - I might suggest a solution: make yourself uncomfortable. At least once a day, go and listen to someone other than I, you, and me."
"I would be speaking in half truths if I didn't cite competition as means of motivation. Except, competition has never motivated me to learn, if anything it's been more of a motivation to grades. Grades and learning: a distinction I still struggle to make, but make nonetheless. So, when other parents ask mine how they make me get certain grades, it's frustrating. My dad usually responds with a witty ""he certainly doesn't get any of that from us."" Something I'm proud of, that my parents don't need some form of positive - or negative - reinforcement to make me learn. However, they miss the point that everything I get is from them. How they have raised me completely impacts my motivation. Just like everything they do is for those they love, my motivation to learn is to be the best for those around me, those I love."
"""That was a wonderful speech by the Executive Director of Kids and Math, Princess Allotey! ..."" Distinguished Toastmaster Papa Arkhurst stated. I smiled and gradually fell into a trance... I was in Junior High School 1 then. It was left with 5 minutes to assembly time. The school prefect, Kofi Ntiamoah, came into the classroom, surveyed the students and called me out. ""Princess, I want you to lead assembly for the primary school children"", he stated. ""Yes"", I replied confidently. 5 minutes later... I became the laughing stock of my school. ""Was this hatched up by Kofi Ntiamoah? I should have rescinded my decision to lead assembly."" I thought sheepishly. 5 minutes earlier... I walked jovially to the school's assembly point. My left hand tucked into my dark brown pocket and my right hand snowboarding around the collar of my light brown shirt to straighten it up. I stamped my foot against the manhole near the opening of the assembly point to free my black shoe from any debris that lay on it after jumping aggressively over; a dozen times, during break time, to beat my opponents in a game of Ampe. (A simple game played by school age children in Ghana.) I positioned myself in front of the Grade 1 to 6 students, ready to set the ball rolling. ""Good Morning Teachers, Good Morning Friends"", I sung out. A couple of students giggled as they realized it was rather afternoon. I tried to play it cool. ""This morning we have gathered here to...um"", I blanked out. Totally. I felt my stomach churn and my bladder give up on me. The pungent yellowish liquid came out, dancing in a wavy manner on my leg, and seeping into my black shoe. Yes, I peed on myself. Three years down the lane, I endured the aftereffects of failing public speaking in 5 minutes. As I progressed to Grade 10, in Achimota School, I faced a new chapter of my life. I felt a desire to change and not to be trapped by the fear of failure because I knew there was more to discover about myself. I placed myself in challenging positions so I could learn - the hard way- and improve upon my public speaking skills. The most challenging being when I vied for the position as Prep Prefect of Achimota School. As a prep prefect, I would have to manage prep hours and convey my ideas to the prep table heads on good study methods. It was also challenging because I was the first female Prep Prefect, and I had to leave a legacy worth of appraisal. There were times when I would speak to a gathering of my peers and misread some words or frequently fix my eyes on my note cards. Amidst laughter, I would focus on giving a clear and simple speech. After graduating high school, I had the opportunity to explore my interests and know my purpose in this world. I founded an organization to help basic school children with Math, which gave me the opportunity to further hone my public speaking skills. When my team was invited to give a speech on Kids and Math at a meeting of the Toastmasters Club at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Ghana, I saw it as an opportunity to get my presentation skills evaluated. With my bespectacled eyes fixed at the audience and my left hand holding my executive shorthand notebook, I began my speech. ""Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am Princess Allotey, Executive Director of Kids and Math. Kids and Math is a..."""
"I want to be a Mathematics teacher one day, but I do not want to be stuck in a Mathematics classroom for four ""college"" years. I believe Mathematics is in the diverse culture I would love to explore when I take a study abroad program. This opportunity will expand my field of view and help me analyze problems and phenomena and also tolerate differences and appreciate diversity. It will also be an inspiration for my organization in Ghana, Kids and Math, to learn more about how to help kids realize and appreciate the versatility of Mathematics, and consequently, to use the expertise obtained to develop the world. In my college experience, I will love to experience an intersection of small class sizes and ""all professor-taught"" classes. With this intersection comes a stronger sense of community and connection, and that is exactly what I envision in my dream college."
"I am an aspiring Mathematics Educator who has taken two gap years since June 2014. During my gap years, I set out on a mission to help underprivileged kids in Ghana develop a strong foundation in Mathematics, nurture their interest and cultivate a willingness to use Mathematics to develop their environment. Though I have not won medals during this journey, I have won hearts of people from different walks of life through my organization - Kids and Math. I am very excited about the discoveries I could make through my four years at Emory College. The opportunities I will be open to will be an inspiration for my team members to learn more about how to help kids realize and appreciate the versatility of Mathematics. I believe there is more to learn about Mathematics and I am ready to be honed to make further impact!"
"My mother was kind. She had plain hazel eyes, but once you came to know her soul, the way she viewed the world around her as if everything was so exciting, the beauty of them became ever so apparent. I don't think there was anything in this world that she loved more than my sister and me. We heard that from everyone. They always told us that she lived for us. After my parents' divorce, Momma began dating Dan, whom she loved almost as much as she loved us, and it wasn't long before he too fell in love with two young girls. I never understood how much my mother loved me. I think I was ignorant to it, or maybe nine years old is too young to attempt to understand a mother's love and actions. After a wayward few years living with her, it came to me in my tiny nine year old body that this isn't the lifestyle that two young girls should be living by. After a wearisome custody battle, my dad inevitably gained almost sole rights. This was another strike against my mom's heart. Then everything got better. Dan worked endlessly to support my mom, and they only made enough to get by. We saw them every weekend, and my mother was officially happy again. Dan got both physically and mentally sick. I remember the day he got out of the hospital, he came to see me and I hugged him for what felt like years. And he was happy. But then Dan lost his job, and he was inconsolably depressed. On that Friday morning two years ago, Momma told him that she was going to the store and then she was going to check him into the hospital. When she came back, he was gone. They found his body a little way down the road they lived on. How do you learn to console your mother at the age of fifteen? Momma used to call me before bed every night. And the night before she passed, she didn't call. It was almost like I knew something wasn't right. The next day, I was checked out of school. My dad didn't even have to tell me why. Something shook my soul the night before. There have been nights I lie in bed wrenching at my chest, at the hole that my mother took with her when she left us. But compared to those nights, there have been even more days that I feel her presence. Because I know that she sees me. she sees someone who sees the world in six dimensions, in a world of people that only see four. She understands the amazement that I have of the world around me, because I got it from her. She understands my hunger for success and thirst for knowledge. And none of it dissipated throughout her nor Dan's passing. It might've even made it stronger. This is my story. This is the story of a girl that lost her stepfather to suicide and her mother to a drug overdose. But these unfortunate events do not define me. They do compose my story. They are simply conflicts in the novel of my life that I overcame, despite the odds. In some ways, I am thankful, not for my mother's and stepfather's death, but because I was given an obstacle- an enormous one at that. And now I know that I am durable. This experience has made the world even more beautiful to me. It has taught me to not take any moment for granted and to live each moment to the fullest and to attack every opportunity I am given. Losing them allowed me to muster up every ounce of strength in my body in order to conquer any obstacle I am faced with to make them proud. Because they died, they taught me to live."
"Some would call us cripplingly inept, others would dare to call us undeniably competent, if we are simply looking at the technological advantages engineering has graced us with. It is for this reason I feel as if my generation has been presented with a hamartia: the threat of technology. We have replaced quality family time with a case of burning eyes resulting in staring at phone screens for too long. We have swapped journal entries with vlog updates, scrapbooks for Instagram pages, and intellectual thought with mundane, irrelevant Facebook posts. With the termination of these honored past times comes the termination of individuality. Our own thoughts become contaminated, even influenced, by the convenient connectivity technology has yielded to us. It seems as though what should be pedastaled in life has been surpassed by the looming availability of social media. After all, they had to name the computer terminal after something."
"By far, The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy is my favorite book for so many reasons. The inexperience in the eyes of a child is by far one of the greatest gifts to our world. Through childhood naivety, Roy illustrates all of the ways in which innocence is stripped from us. Pair this with lush, vivid prose and the effect of jumps in time, you have in front of you an overwhelmingly metaphysical yet relatable piece of fiction impossible to tear your eyes from. The story line acts as a force field preventing the reader's mind from losing contact with clouds of profoundly beautiful thoughts and words. And the best part of it all is the irony- the wholesomeness of Roy's perspective, dubbed with the unequivocal ugliness of humanity and the way it both destructs and repairs us, is enough to overwhelm you and bring you to tears."
"My diverse choice of coursework in my high-school kept me engrossed and well-informed about a wide-variety of issues, starting from microscopic chemical changes to the global issues shaping world politics. However, as my courses got increasingly specialized, I sought general information to satiate my curiosity about the world, and this led me towards debating. I found the intellectual conversations of these club meetings stimulating and was enjoying the debate classes until one day, when all of us were asked to prepare individual speeches on ""Human Rights"" as a part of the selection process of the school's debating team. I had a rough idea about the topic at hand, and hoped to make a notable first impression in front of my seniors and coach. When my turn came, I walked up to the podium and looked up to the collective set of eyes fixated on me, ready to judge what I'd be saying. Standing there, staring back into those eyes, I became completely transfixed. I had the content of my speech engraved on the back of my mind, yet somehow, I could not express them. I felt somewhat helpless, losing control of my own mind and body. I began trembling, as my face turned red from a mixture of panic and embarrassment. I barely spoke a few isolated words before awkwardly taking my seat, while others struggled to keep their laughter contained. Not only did I not get selected, but I also made a complete fool out of myself. However, instead of discouraging me, this failure ultimately became my motivation to work tirelessly and become a debater at the national level. Knowing that the obvious area I needed to work on was my apparent stage fright, I started working on my public-speaking skills. To overcome my initial stutter, I began speaking in front of the mirror daily, repeating each of my speeches until they became fluent and flawless and later, I made my family sit through my speeches at home. Moreover, I realized that articulation and eloquence, while important, are secondary to the legitimacy and analysis of the arguments. To improve, I needed to understand the issues comprehensively, beyond a superficial level. Hence, I started reading on the common socio-political issues, macro-economics affecting world markets, and all matters related to current affairs. I learned about various techniques and strategies of debate and as I overcame my fears and began to improve, I got more actively involved in the debate sessions, and eventually got selected as the youngest member of the school's debate team. Ever since, I've been a consistent member of the team, winning numerous trophies and accolades for my school over the years. For my success and commitment, I was selected as the President of the Debate Club in my last year of high school, during which, I led the club to five major National trophies. Looking back, I sometimes marvel at how that initial failure - encouraging me to constantly venture outside my comfort zone and welcome challenges in all aspects of my life - changed me from that timid, shivering child into an accomplished leader within my community. Truth be told, I'm still afraid of failures, as I'm sure most people are. However, the fear of giving up on pursuing a passion because of anticipated failures feels far more crippling. This experience taught me to use that fear constructively to bring out the best of me and fuel my determination to achieve success. I learned to see failures not as setbacks, but as lessons that can bring one closer to accomplishing a long-term goal! With that in mind, I look forward to the biggest challenge of my life till now - going to the land of dreams to pursue my higher education as an international student. I'm well aware of the obstacles that I'm likely to face and I cannot wait to see how this new adventure unfolds!"
"One of the most appealing aspects of an education as an international student was the completely new environment I would be immersed in. College is the best place to refine my outlook on life and that can only be done through exposure to a diversity of people, ideas, and culture. Such a community would allow me to learn about new cultures and background, and look at the world from an alternate perspective. In my ideal campus, people would use the differences between them to understand and appreciate one another, creating an inclusive and tightly-knit community where everyone is willing to help and support one another. There, I would feel free to share my unique identity, culture and set of ideas with everyone and build friendships that will last a lifetime. Such a diverse and hospitable community would make my journey as an international student much more smooth and enlightening."
"I've always found it fascinating how a mere set of codes can transform a piece of metal into a program-driven machine capable of solving complex problems and displaying human-like intelligence. I envied the programmers who were able to bring their imagination to life using nothing but numbers and codes. The craving for this very feeling sparked my interest in Computer Science Being from Bangladesh, a country where more than a third of the population is uneducated, I intend to use my computing skills to work with technological giants and educational pioneers such as ""Khan Academy"" to devise a highly interactive and personalized educational software that will enable individuals across the globe to pursue any level of education independently and effectively. My fascination, along with the will to contribute to my community and society, fuels my determination to build a sound knowledge of computing theory and pursue a career in programming."
"I was not born to be self-motivated. However, the special family and early schooling ""trained"" me to be motivated. Since I was very young, stress has been a powerful trait to propel me to do better. From the beginning of elementary school, I received good grades and was well-behaved. My family often said to my cousins, ""My boy/girl, you really need to learn from your cousin!"" I was very proud of myself when I heard my aunts and uncles said this to my cousins. It made me always want to be my best, whether in school or at home. However, this appeared to have negative consequences because my cousins felt jealousy. To alter this misunderstanding and to positively influence my peers, I talked to my relatives sincerely and told them, ""Since we are family, I'm willing to provide any help as long as you ask me for it!"" Although I self-imposed more pressure to perfect myself to be a good model, bonds between family members were strengthened during this process, to make my family more harmonious. At first, it was difficult for me to get used to the increasing pressure but, gradually, I grew comfortable with the feeling of being a role model. The situation was similar in my primary school, which was a very traditional primary school in China. It meant cramming and being identified in a ranking system. Classmates, teachers, and even parents would judge a student base on his/her ranking: this method caused every student a great deal of pressure. Fortunately, my mother, who is an open-minded woman, was encouraging and non-judgmental. She is a real role model. I gradually found out why I loved the feeling of being stressed: to get a good grade, I needed to spend extra time on studying. Getting tired while studying gave me a sense of satisfaction. As I have matured, I have changed pressure into motivation, and this ability has helped me to maintain good mental health."
"Many people are addicted to illegal drugs, which is a tragedy for those addicted and for their nations. Meanwhile, many people are unconsciously addicted to smart phones as well, which are legal but also come with negative consequences. It has been a common phenomenon among my peers to sit at the table during a family dinner at home or in a restaurant, where everyone is ""talking"" to their smart phones on social networks instead of to their family members. Smart phones do make our world smaller through shortening the ""distances"" between and among people. Meanwhile, it is depriving the teenagers of their ability to communicate face-to-face, which is essential to their future success. There is no doubt that smart phones will keep developing at an incredible speed. Meanwhile, how to properly handle this double-edged sword will be an important challenge for my generation."
"Living in a country that has a different culture from my country is definitely what I am excited about. Although I have visited the U.S. before, there has been no chance for me to experience the nuances of American culture. Having a four-year experience in an American college for undergraduate school is an opportunity for me to grow academically and socially. Besides from experiencing a new culture, learning in the field of biomedical engineering would fulfill my promise to my grandfather who died five years ago of lung cancer. The day he died I promised him that I would do everything I could to find a cure for cancer. I believe that studying in a great university like Emory University can help me to fulfill my promise."
"Although I figured out what his French words meant, my response instinctively came out in Latin: ""Salve! Nomen mihi est Abraham."" Olivier laughed. He realized I was a fiddler because of my ""violin hickey,"" the mark on my neck where my violin's chinrest rubs. Switching to fluent but heavily-accented English, Olivier began talking with me about the similarities and differences between the folk and classical music traditions we each love and study. After our brief discussion, he invited me to call him Olo and suggested I bring my Celtic-fusion trio Maelstrom to jam with his band later that evening. Le Vent Du Nord, a French-Canadian band which plays traditional Quebecois music, performed twice in DC last year: first in a solo concert and then for a contradance. After years of listening obsessively to their albums and trying to learn their tunes, I was eager to see them both times. I watched in awe as the four members of the band effortlessly switched languages and styles. Their performances were full of joy and energy, but they also highlighted the social and political issues that underlie their music, including the conflicting influences of the colonization of Canada by both the French and the British. I was first introduced to folk music through my mother's family. My uncle plays everything from Old-Time banjo to Turkish bouzouki. My grandfather played jazz piano and the songs of the Civil Rights movement on guitar. My musical tastes branched out even further when my friends Peri and Darrow introduced me to Irish music. We put together the trio Maelstrom where we experiment with the connections between various traditions. Recently we've been exploring links between Celtic, Balkan, and Klezmer music. Once we arrived to jam with Le Vent du Nord that evening, the conversation was primarily in French. Another Quebecois band, also performing in the DC area, joined us. Many of the members of De Temps Antan are the younger siblings of Le Vent Du Nord musicians. We quickly learned that a true party happens, as Olo explained to me, in the kitchen. The two professional bands and the three of us gathered around a table covered with cheese platters, chocolate, and drinks. We alternated between jamming and talking about music. I asked Olo about the distinctive foot-tapping, a sort of seated tap-dancing, that he does while fiddling. He explained that the foot percussion called ""podorythmie"" provides the rhythmic underlay, a heartbeat rhythm, to any Quebecois jam. As he spoke, he frequently slipped into French, but I still managed to learn a few of the basic steps from him as he laughingly mimed them for me. At the end of the party as we packed up our instruments, Olo invited us to a music festival and camp in Quebec next summer. When my bandmates and I talked about it the next day, we realized we needed to learn French to get the most out of the experience. Although all of us had studied foreign languages before, none of us could speak more than a few words of French. We searched for a tutor and found Prof. Chantal. She is fascinated by variations in the French spoken in Paris, in the other regions of the country, and in other French-speaking countries around the world. My flashcards get increasingly complex as she teaches us forms used in the different dialects of French. She is also a singer who loves traditional music. Each week, we work through songs with her, arrange harmonies, and then sing them together. This fall I'm busy learning traditional tunes, writing new ones, and performing gigs with Maelstrom, as well as studying French. I'm eager to greet the musicians of Le Vent du Nord next summer with a hearty ""Bonjour! Nous sommes prets a jouer de la musique traditionnelle!"""
"The internet brings people together. It creates connections across the world and gives people resources to learn new things. I can keep in touch with friends from California and Swaziland, take courses online, and listen to musicians around the world on YouTube. Knowing about the diversity of world music has expanded my horizons. It allows my folk band to create fusions of different styles. Still, without the ability to play music together and dance together, folk traditions will change radically. This music, these dances, and these stories will lose their potency. Connections made online are often project-based and non-simultaneous, leading to a social dynamic where respect and empathy are sometimes dispensable. Communicating with each other through technology can leave us disconnected, despite the opportunities it brings. My generation must learn to combine the understanding of diversity that global connection can give us with the history and compassion we develop locally."
"As a Shakespeare nerd, I am frequently asked what my favorite play is. I often answer The Winter's Tale, a play that explores the role of art, theater, and music in society. Con-man Autolycus habitually lies in spoken language, but he communicates his true thoughts to the audience through music. A young shepherd is too shy to express his complex feelings for two women, but he is able to through song. The Winter's Tale also explores how theater uses fiction to speak the truth. When in disguise, characters act out truths they cannot express in their daily lives. The same proves true of visual art. At the end of the play, an exquisite sculpture allows Leontes to reunite with his queen, even after years of distrust and silence. As a musician and an actor, I am deeply attracted to Shakespeare's argument that art is a form of true communication."
"My mum told me the contributions i made for solving certain problems and the kind of questions I used to ask when growing up. She said I asked: ""Ah!, Why is water wet?"" with a confused facial expression and my jaw dropped and ""why can't I drive"" with a frown, and i'd always say; ""but you can do it this way too"" or ""that would be better"". My face beamed with smiles whenever I imagined myself ask those questions; was I not a funny little cute child? But I guess my whys and efforts at helping with certain problems were only acceptable to the society I lived in when i was a cute little baby because for as long as I can recall, i got rebuked for contributing to elderly conversations. Whether I was right or wrong, I was wrong; ""you are only a child"", they would say. Seeing that my contributions to solving problems were not so welcome by the people in my community, I redirected my efforts to school, where I could be me and not rebuked. In grade school, I was very attentive in class and asked a lot of questions. I grasped everything i was being taught so fast; and was called to board very often to solve questions. Having paid much attention to my teachers, I almost always had a different or summarized approach to solving problems which i devised while the teacher taught. Outside of class, I peer tutored my classmates and sometimes was challenged to study upper class topics so I could help upper graders. Every time I asked a question or explained a concept to the satisfactory applause of the class, My face beamed with smiles because I had the opportunity to be myself. This habit of wanting to know and do more followed me Opoku Ware Senior High School, one of the best schools in Ghana. I went from being class prefect to becoming my grade representative in the Student Council. One day, a thought occurred to me: What good is it if only I can voice out and serve humanity?. I decided to set up clubs to help make others like me, speaking up on issues and transforming the world in their own small ways. With a strong urge to see things become better, I brought many clubs into existence such as the Make it club into existence where students could make anything: simple robots, molded sculptures, simple levers, etc. I made this club purposely to help students like myself explore their potentials. I led the making of a solar oven with the help of my physics professor and my team, which was put in my school's collection and exhibition room, probably collecting dust now. I joined the debaters club and there also, my traits distinguished me. I won for Opoku Ware School the regional debates and became president by just portraying who I was, a critical, astute youth, passionate about making a difference everywhere I go. I joined Service to All Humankind(SAHA), an organization by a group of students Abroad, and got to teach kids in rural villages of Northern Ghana after High School. There also, I did not forget to cement in the minds of these less privileged children to always pursue their interests and seek the improvement of our world at large. When I take a step back to look at who I am now, and what i want to become in future, I see that I could not have gotten this far without the will to inquire into situations and the passion to contribute to society. I look back and smile at the old elders. Just maybe, I wouldn't have come this far if I didn't make the old grade school my heaven."
"Of all the wonders Emory has to offer, I am most thrilled about being involved in a vibrant student body that seeks to serve the world. Emory is known for its service driven work. In an environment such as this, motivated world changers are sure to spring up. I share in Emory's choice of public interest, compassion and science and I am optimistic about programs at Emory that seek the interest of the world.I am most excited about sharing in this passion of helping others. Making use of the various opportunities such as disease research with professors and volunteering, I intend to be prepared to serve humanity. I cannot wait to be in Emory for this, because beginning the process of indulging in these opportunities excites my hope to impact the world."
"I draw motivation from anything. I remember even once, when I had been jilted by someone I admired because she claimed I spoke unrefined English, I imbibed and used so much vocabulary that I was nicknamed, Verbose Papa. I realized later that I had drawn motivation to study from that negative encounter. I learn because of what I need to be:A tool to help humanity. I am pushed to my books when I observe the well hidden struggle that goes on in the provision of my needs at home. I am propelled learn when I imagine all those people I can help out of illness in my village. In school, I am propelled into focus on my studies by the seriousness of the focused few I am usually found with. When all fails, I look to the inner voice who knows me most."
"It is a hot and humid Saturday afternoon, but here I am in the air-conditioned wonderland that is the King of Prussia Mall, looking for a birthday present for my sister Sonali. Suddenly, as I step onto the escalator, heading down to Nordstrom, my mind flashes back to when I was eight years old. My grandparents, sister, and I were traveling to Atlanta for my aunt's 40th birthday party. Taking the escalator to the baggage claim, I found myself intrigued by the hair-like brushes along the edges of the belt. A typically curious eight-year-old, I pressed my toes against them and, suddenly, my foot was snared. I shrieked and my grandpa and another man started pulling at me. Finally, the escalator came to a halt and Grandpa managed to wrest my foot free. My sneaker was completely shredded and several of my toes were bleeding or were bent way back. Soon the medics arrived and one of them, a very kind woman, carefully cleaned away the blood and treated the wound, calming me as best she could. When she was finished, I thanked her, truly inspired by how she handled the situation, and she gave me a hug. This incident set off a phobia of escalators that continued for the next five years. I avoided public spaces-shopping malls, movie theaters, theme parks-out of fear that the incident would be repeated. Nothing changed until I went to India when I was 13. What I saw there had a profound effect on me. There were so many people who were homeless or living in straw huts without clean water or who struggled with disabilities that I came to see how lucky I was. That trip put my escalator phobia into perspective, as did what came next in my life. At 15, I was diagnosed with a hypothyroid condition, in which the thyroid gland does not make enough of the hormone thyroxin, which plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism. This underactive thyroid disorder has had a great impact on body, causing me to gain more than 25 pounds and putting me at risk of diabetes. In our society, we are constantly flooded with images of women who are almost preternaturally thin. These images are often the product of photoshopping and represent an ideal that I, for one, will never be able to attain, based on my body type. My doctor asked me to stop eating foods that most teenagers eat, like pizza, bread, and French fries. I would see other friends at school who would be eating whatever they wanted, and I felt like I did not belong in the same community. Consequently, I became insecure about myself. I worried that my life would change and that I wouldn't be able to achieve my goals of becoming a successful neurosurgeon or neuroscientist or have rewarding personal relationships. Once again, however, I thought of the people I encountered in India who are so less fortunate than I am and I resolved not to let myself become depressed. I still have to take a pill every day, hoping that my thyroid function will become normal, but over the last year, committed to my future and a new lifestyle, I have changed my diet and motivated myself to exercise. In a funny way, I have come to understand that life is sort of like an escalator. Sometimes you go up, sometimes down, and sometimes-hopefully, rarely-your foot gets stuck. The only solution is to live life to the fullest, and this realization has helped me on my journey from childhood to adulthood. Now what would be a good birthday gift for Sonali? I wonder, as I approach the end of my ride. As always, I feel a shiver of anxiety as I prepare to disembark, but then my feet hit terra firma and I am good to go. Goodbye, escalator. Onward to Nordstrom!"
"What began to excite me about the potential to attend Emory was its proximity to Atlanta, one of the most stimulating cities in which to reside. Naturally, the primary reasons for my interest to attend this highly-reputable university are its renown for excellence, its vast resources, and alternative curricula, especially dual degree among other, related programs that could enable my attendance to one of the most prestigious schools, and, thus pursue my goals to specialize in neurology and still allow my continued studies in math. I look forward to interacting with those who share my interests within a culturally diverse environment, both of which would enhance and enrich my experience at Emory. I am eager to have the highly-coveted opportunity to participate in Emory's cutting-edge curriculum, state-of-the-art research, incomparable instruction, and the eventual potential to attain a degree from a leading facility such as Emory College of Arts and Sciences."
"I believe in a holistic Liberal Arts and Sciences academic education that would provide a solid foundation in not only a major in science or math but also in other areas such as research, technology or business. This would enable me to focus on developing my problem- solving and analytical skills. An ideal university environment should entail more than academics. All students require a proper balance between study and socialization, especially when they leave home for college and soon realize the need for friends with whom to just have fun but also on whom they can rely. Many freshmen experience loneliness and isolation; failure to address this can result in a loss of well-being and happiness, taxing their health and impacting performance. The best solution is for everyone to be vigilant simply noting if all others are acclimating to college life."
"Who was I? I had stared in the mirror and wondered about this question before I got admitted by Shenzhen Senior High School. The one recognized by my parents or the one I really was? The man reflected by the mirror was tall with black eyes and yellow skin. In people's views, he was smart, thoughtful, and mature. He was cherished by the people around him. However, despite the praise, his face was covered by makeup. By Chinese standards, merit students should have good grades and listen to parents. If they matched these two aspects, then they were good students. Other things were not as important. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I met those standards. Then, what I was expected to do was to follow the customary way. I did not want to, but they had a powerful weapon to get me to do it-their wish. "" I wish""was more forceful than ""you should."" People could hardly defy expectations. Neither could I. When my parents talked about weekend activities on Friday, they constantly supressed me by having their expectations. In their minds, I would always study like a nerd every weekend just like people would always eat three meals per day. Frequently, I remained silent and canceled my plans, if I had any, because of their expectations. Then, I gradually found out that my face was covered by makeup. Living up to other's hopes was not an easy job. It made me very tired, not only physically but also mentally. My road was predetermined by others and whatever I did only led me become more ensnared in it. ""I was not myself!"" Until one day I made my own voice. When I received an admission from Shenzhen Senior High school, an excellent school, my parents, as usual, assumed this was what I could and should do. They also believed I would get good scores on the Gaokao in order to be admitted by a prominent national university. However,I did not want to. Instead of following their plans, I wanted to go abroad. They were astonished since I was no longer fit their prototype. They questioned my decision. However, I made up my mind because I had had enough of being a puppet.After a long night with arguments, they finally decided to support my decision. I choose to go abroad because I want to do something new, something that will impress me, something that can define me. Life is pretty short. Owing to this, people need to be themselves when they are young. When I became a trainee in a foreign bank, one of the senior managers said that she could not be herself because she was no longer young and passionate. My parents also stated things like this. From these, I realize I have to break out of my traps right now. Otherwise, I may live under the makeup forever. Wiping off my makeup, I change myself. Instead of studying like a nerd on summer vacation, I dive in Sipadan, Malaysia, to discover the beauty of the ocean; instead of waking up late at the weekend, I get up early to spread information about coral reefs to let people know that there are creatures which need to be protected from pollution; and instead of wandering the street, I work with my grandpa to research on the micro structure of the lotus leaves. While my friends only need to worry about their scores because they will study in a Chinese university, I need to deal with application essays, GPA, activities, and standard tests. They will always ask me whether I feel regret for my decision, I always reply never. Regardless of what my future will be, I develop my own road. What I need to do is to keep going on it. So, who am I? A diver, an environmentalist, and a passionate youth."
"The most important challenge that my generation will face in the next 50 years is how the United States, as the current world super power, and China, a rising star, will interact and share global influence and resources. As a Chinese, although I cannot deny that there are many deficiencies in China right now, it continues to improve at a dramatic pace. Its influence on the international stage will keep growing because of its population, GDP, and territory area. As a result, despite the fact that America is still the only super power in the world, it has to know how to negotiate with China. With its growing strength, China can hardly be ignored in the future. The question going forward is how these two countries will cooperate with each other and make the world better."
"People rarely choose to leave their comfort zones. For example, when I am used to taking a bath and napping after school, it is very hard for me to change my habits and choose to read a book instead. Likewise, when I am accustomed to being quiet in class, it is difficult for me to suddenly raise my hand for questions. Studying in a college, especially an excellent college like Emory, would be a great opportunity to force me out of my comfort zone! This is an excellent way for me to learn because if I cannot learn quickly, I will be knocked out. I love this challenge. Sometimes, people need to push hard to reach their limits. Otherwise, they can never hope to reach their potentials. As a result, I am looking forward to being taken out of my comfort zone by studying at Emory!"
"I now know that lice shampoo has to be used on dry hair, and a follow up treatment a week later will ensure its effectiveness. I also know regular BBQ charcoal, when ground up, can make rain water safe enough to drink. I also know a waterproof tarp can be fashioned into a waterproof home using only two long rods during the monsoon season. These problem are not my own. If they were, I would not be fortunate enough to be writing this. Instead they belong to the tenacious and incredibly admirable villagers an ocean away in Kathputli Colony, New Delhi. Sonu and Neeraj's eyes lit up as I entered the classroom. Several centimeters taller but just as adorable as before, the brothers cried in tandem ""Christine didi(sister)!"" as they rushed over to me. I gave them a warm embrace and just let the feeling sink in. Seeing the happiness in their eyes, one might assume that they, and their community, are not facing problems that are life-and-death. Remnants of the day's lessons were dotted across the wall: hand-drawn flags, vocabulary posters, solved math problems. This dilapidated classroom is so much more than its four mud wall. It is a refuge for the present, a hope for the future, and a solution I can be a part of. As Nelson Mandela so succinctly stated, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" I believe it. It is why I am here. Our school is a sanctuary for the families who live in Kathputli Colony that provides free meals, simple medical services, and education for all who come. Catching the last glint of sunlight through the windows, I realized the stark contrast to what existed outside. The walls of this place were not meant to keep the students in, instead, they were meant to keep the harsh realities of the world out. I was honored to have been accepted again for the teaching rotation over the summer, and to be a part of a working solution. This year, I am responsible for most of the curriculum. The twelve months apart from the school allow me to prepare a dynamic program including various subjects. But that's not all we are responsible for. From small construction efforts to delousing hair, no task was too big or too small if it meant making a positive impact on the community. Most pressing of all was the lack of access to the most basic medical or dental care. Near the end of my term there, as I am lethargically mopping the floor in the stifling heat, an older woman stands nervously at the door. A tear is slowly making its way through her lined face. The woman had a small lump in her cheek where she had stuffed cloves as pain reliever. She struggled to explain that she had not been able to eat solid food for several days. Her bony, weathered hands firmly grasped mine, urging me to help. I feel a deep sense of despair and frustration, knowing there is nothing I can do. New Delhi struggles to provide even basic resources to its most needy citizens. No amount of English lessons, outreach programs, or food banks can completely eradicate these problems. But I will not give up on them. My direction is already determined; I will pursue an education in healthcare with my eyes brightly focusing on the problems I see and provide real solutions. Cynical people may predict that I will forget this dream and use my future profession for my own self-profit instead. They have not encountered my stubborn determination, and more importantly, they have not experienced Kathputli Colony."
"Katie Davis was a student, an eighteen-year-old girl just as I am, with a cookie cutter life ahead of her. However, she rewrote her own story and allowed her compassion led her to the barren landscape of Uganda. At the age of nineteen, she became the adoptive mother of thirteen Ugandan children, and later the founder of the Amazima School, the Christian secondary school for vulnerable children. She recorded her fascinating story of relentless love in ""Kisses from Katie,"" which had lastingly inspired me and motivated me to act. ""...we were each created to change the world for someone. To serve someone. To love someone the way Christ first loved us."" Davis' life story always remind me the potential I have in impacting other stories. I've kept these words from Davis close to my heart because it rings truth to me."
"Stars looks trivial when they shine in the dark night, but they also represent the most significant question marks in human history-time, space, origin, and end. Just like how stars live and die to produce light that travels for light years, I always believe that life is merely a journey to earth that allows us to explore and answer some question marks for life in the future. When I look up to the stars in dark night, they always remind me the unlimited mechanics that left unexplained. Their existence prompt my curiosity towards mysteries. They motivate me to learn the most out of my journey here in order to discover, and become a star that left its light to life hundred or billions years ahead."
"Never had I been so fascinated by Streptococcus lactis. I stood in front of the incubator, a Petri dish in my hand, and scrutinized each and every square millimeter of the round plate of agar, my exultation elevating after every colony I saw on the dish. This was my moment of triumph. I had successfully cultured bacteria in our school lab. The previous guy who had tried something similar had ended up getting hospitalized by contracting some sort of mild pneumonia, and so the notion of doing the task was first met by a reluctant resistance from my teachers. Stingy statements like ""What exactly do you want to do it for?"" ricocheted back as replies, and wisps of gossips frolicked around the biology department about an A level student who was attempting something 'totally out of his reach'. Perhaps the hesitance was partly because they were too quick to conclude it was too early for me to do such a thing, but the main reason was that the dangers that would result if the experiment didn't go as planned were high. Also, never had anyone else performed it successfully in our lab. What had started as a fun experiment was now slowly and palpably materializing into an arduous challenge with skeptical eyes anticipating the outcome. The gossips continued, and the criticisms multiplied, but those things did not deter me from my aim. I knew I wanted to do this, so I set to work. The first thing I needed to do was to get the base medium ready. I went to the school library and plunged into the world of books where biology and chemistry combined to give a synergistic elegance that defined every aspect of the experiment. I learned about the media that bacteria required for proper growth, and ended up making one of my own by mixing gelatin, milk, sugar and methyl orange. I named it the Oscar agar. I also went through a few fat books of Bacteriology to select the most innocuous bacteria that would be suitable for the experiment, so as to prevent me from catching a disease. Streptococcus lactis did the job perfectly. I used the percolator to prepare the agar (thanks to my biology teacher), and a dilapidated rusting box of an incubator that looked more like an oven to set it hard. So far things were going great. But then came the next day. The gelatin melted due to a high incubating temperature, and mould sprang up from the medium instead of bacteria. That just proved that culturing bacteria wasn't as easy as I had thought, and that came down pretty hard upon me. I could already feel my teachers mocking me derisively for making a mess out of it, and my plans for displaying it on the School Day crumbling down in pieces. But now, as I turn back and look at that moment, I am almost thankful that I didn't succeed that day. Had I succeeded in the first attempt, my further experiments would have been all about attempting to perform complex things just to prove my teachers wrong. It would be more about doing something to prove myself right than to actually engage myself intellectually and delve into the beauty and elegance of the task I would be performing. My passion would cease to exist, and everything would have turned into a dreadful obligation to be fulfilled in front of a few judging heads. But thankfully, the experiment not only refueled my passion for microbiology, but also reminded me of the ultimate reason why I do anything: to foster my intellect. And finally, after three months and seven attempts, I did display my culture plate on the school day, and I didn't bother about whether my teachers were impressed. I knew I had learned a lot from the experience, and that was more than enough to make me happy."
"Antibiotic resistance is not a new phenomenon. We've been warned about it since the discovery of Penicillin, but yet little has been done to combat its ramifications. The causes are as simple as misusing antibiotics by feeding it to livestock, but the consequences are as deadly as a global pandemic caused by a superbug. And worse, the worst is already on the move; according to the WHO, the deaths attributable to antimicrobial resistance per year will reach a devastating figure of 10 million by 2050. However, the catastrophes of antibiotic resistance can be prevented through diligent study and research, and hence the ultimate role to counteract its effects lies in the hands of medical researchers. Medical scientists from across the world should therefore converge and work together to find a new alternative for present day antibiotics, because that is the ultimate challenge our generation faces in the next 50 years."
"The most valuable thing I envision in my ideal collegiate experience is diversity. Being a student amidst a vibrant and diverse student body with various cultural backgrounds would indeed be a matter of great delight, because the academia would be greatly enhanced by the diversity of the students who bring their cultural backgrounds and experiences to lively discussions and the exchange of ideas in the classroom. Such an invigorating academic setting would truly engage the transformative power of the differences within the student body to cultivate intellectual discovery, and that is the perfect environment that I, as an international student with a unique background, look forward to the most in my college experience."
"A little girl,believing she'd found the key to immortality,nestled behind the door, watching her grandmother boiling her oriental medicine in the porcelain pot.Several packs of herbs sat on the table.Grandmother stirred the pot for a long time, and sweet smells diffused. After turning off the fire, she decanted the liquid into a bottle and threw away the dried plants.The little girl was curious about how her grandmother's medicine was made. The potions did not look like the medicine her parents gave her when she was sick: those were always capsules, powders, and syrups; none of them needed to be boiled before using. Grandmother told the girl that only Chinese herbology was useful for her backache, not Western drugs. So at the age of six, after watching her grandmother yet again, the little girl finally tried to make her own medicine by herself from the plants in the garden. Like the herbs in grandmother's packs, the ones she collected must be the freshest, best shaped and without wormholes. She also imitated grandmother's method of medicine's decoction. She assured herself one day, her invented drug would kill all diseases and no one in the world would have to suffer from disease and pain. This girl was me of twelve years ago. My childish desire kept my interest in herbs and made me curious about all the plants I came across. I had my own notebooks full of collected plants and their uses. For vacations, I loved going to primitive forests and looked for the herbs I had read in my medical herb encyclopedias -a gift from my parents. After school time, my grandmother oriental store was also my place to go. I'd watch my grandmother and her customers in the main room from her office. Because the door connecting the two rooms was covered only by a plastics beaded curtain I could clearly hear then without being noticed and learned what herbs treated what diseases. My notebooks were gradually added notes of different medicine's prescriptions, uses,and dosages. The time I spent observing the customers was the time of examining knowledge and making questions. A pack of curcumin, Cucurbitaceae, atiso, chan pei and yellow skin and a beer belly? He must have problems with his liver. But when he took the medicine, what was happening within the person? Later,my advanced biology lessons in high school could answer the question. A man took the bottle containing brown liquid to his mouth. The consecutive events in his body appeared in my mind.The liquid moved into his stomach through his esophagus and went to the small intestine, where almost the drugs were absorbed by the mucosa in the capillary vessels, and finally dispersed throughout his body. Next step was receptor mechanism, bringing bioactive content in medicine to affected cells-the receptors. But now what medicine to what cells? The questions led me to a change in my hobby that I spent more time in the school laboratory than in elsewhere. With the help of my teachers and the Internet, I carried out experiments and eventually found that different extracting methods would result in different amounts of final useful compounds. I began to realize how many herbal medicine companies in Vietnam make fake medicine or fail to report ingredients in medicine on the labels, for example, many add antibiotics which can lead to antimicrobial resistance. The research for cheap and efficient extracting method is now the solution for the matter. My notebooks one more time changed its contents: names of leaves' medical active compounds and receptors and my lab's record and methods were included. Children always ask consecutive questions of a topic until they get what they want. The grown up usually lose their curiosity and desire to know a matter's deep root. Luckily, I don't lose my interest in why and how questions. They are my spirit's medicine, making me live positively and influencing my actions."
"At younger age,to protect my ego,I hurt others.The feeling of satisfaction does not last long but the cost for that is too expensive:losing my beloved,seeing their sadness and disappointment and damaging our relationships.Luckily,I had The Underneath,a book that lulled me to sleep every night since the age of eight until two years ago,remind me the lessons of longanimity and forgiveness.From the beginning,the story is full of loneliness,hatred and loss.A mystic creature,solitude for thousands years before meeting and wholeheartedly loving her daughter in law,lost the daughter due to her selfishness and big ego.A dog,chained and unfed by his owner because of a trivial mistake,brooded over his loss of freedom day after day.But kindled in those sad events of the story were reminiscences of the characters' loving moments and their hope of genuine love's return.For many times,doors for atonement and love appeared open.Once the character chooses the door,they achieve freedom in souls."
"The desire to create is always my motivation for studying.Since I was in elementary school, I had a fervid imagination and creativeness. The things I want to make vary from trivial to seemingly large: from an adhesive rubber band to preventing heel pain through new shoes to a machine which can assess and diagnose diseases for fish in their habitats. Some creations I can make with ease since they do not require any specific knowledge. But a meaningful invention, like my imaginary machine, cannot be made without particular knowledge, theories and experiences. In the case of my machine, the knowledge must include a background knowledge of robotics, electrical engineering, water- resistant technology, as well as the ecology of fish habitats, which require time of learning, researching and experimenting.To create, one has to learn first."
"At the age of three, I moved from South Korea to Cambridge, England. Because of my limited knowledge of English, all I watched was cartoons on TV. Most of them were just another story to me. But 'The Ugly Duckling' by Hans Christian Andersen felt different: I felt that I was the Ugly Duckling in real life. My early life was not a stable one: moving from country to country, saying goodbye was just another routine. At each new home, I was the Ugly Duckling. Looking at myself in the mirror, I knew I was the outsider. My hair and eyes were deep, dark black while theirs were blonde and blue. I would ask for chopsticks while they used forks. Simply the words ""different"" and ""peculiar"" stuck with me as I grew up as the Ugly Duckling. At lunch during school, I would struggle with my identity. Always looking out for the tiny spot in the corner of the cafeteria, I made sure that nobody noticed me and my lunch. My lunch was simple: in a bright yellow box with a bunny drawing, there would always be five perfectly aligned Korean rice balls (onigiri). I was ashamed of myself for packing such food with strong spice and for having a childish lunch box. I was also missing the appreciation that my lunch was more than just an everyday necessity. It wasn't until later that I realized that my lunch transported me back to my grandma's kitchen, always filled with the fresh, sweet smell of rice cooking. To the days when my joy was filled with friends sitting around a table laughing and eating onigiri together. It also represented my family left behind in Korea, cheering me on as I make this unpredictable journey of life. Onigiri was my childhood, my identity. I told myself to be like the ordinary ducklings: just fit in. Making a habit of hiding my differences, my identity started to slip away. At the end of sixth grade, I was called down to a first grade classroom to help a student out. At the entrance was someone like me: eyes blurred with tears and face flushed with frustration. The teacher introduced the girl, Claire, and then told me that today was Claire's first day in an American school. The kids at lunch had made fun of her food. Kneeling in front her, I held Claire's fragile hands and a tear landed on my palms. ""It's OK,"" I whispered. With her eyes still moist with tears, Claire cautiously asked if she was allowed to bring Korean food to school. ""Why would you do it again?"" I asked, and her reply was simple: ""Because I'm Korean and I love Korean food."" Claire's confidence in her identity suddenly made me ashamed of myself. For being scared. For being embarrassed about being myself: short, brown eyes, a Korean. Just like the duckling I saw on the TV, I was looking for the perfect place where I could be myself. It took me most of my childhood to realize that I was not, in fact, an Ugly Duckling. I was an Extraordinary Duckling. In high school, I went on to organize an ""International Food Festival"" at my school. While introducing the food and culture of Korea, I got to experience other countries' diverse cultural backgrounds and delicious foods. I learned to help elementary students with diverse backgrounds embrace their identities and realize that they are special ducklings. I created a mentorship program to reach out to young students in the community to help them realize out that being an outsider can be something special. In this world full of ethnic and cultural diversity, there are still people-young and old-who are struggling to just fit in. At this point in my life, I will continue to help those in need of discovering the extraordinary abilities held within their differences."
"My life mentor once told me a story by David Foster Wallace that addressed the challenge our generation will come to face: ignorance. The story goes like this: Two young fish meet an older fish, who asks them ""How's the water?"" The younger fish look at each other and say, ""What the hell is water?"". This story represents our generation being oblivious to their environment, taking it for granted. However, if we pay just a tiny bit of our attention and our time to our surroundings, we can appreciate something as simple as a flower growing on the sidewalk or even the basic humanity of those around us. By really looking, we can start to change people's lives. We can become leaders, links that can bridge the gaps. We can create a world full of positivity. I hope we will work to build community, bring energy, and create action."
"John Sebastian Bach's 'Die Kunst der Fugue' is my favorite piece of music because it challenged me to become an inspirational, motivational leader. Unfortunately, the piece breaks off abruptly in the middle due to Bach's death, leaving it incomplete. The opening of the fugue starts with a musical subject and subject entries come fast and condensed, falling over one another like a waterfall. Even though it was not what Bach intended to represent, to me the different form of the same subject represents our heterogeneous society. And the intricate layering of the subject represents how we, the heterogeneous society, must harmonize together to become successful and promote synergy. Like 'Die Kunst der Fuge', is an incomplete work, I am still not the perfect leader. However, this music will always remind me of the challenge I've accepted to become a passionate, inspirational leader with power to bring harmony to our community."
"Half Sri Lankan, half Australian. It's not the most common mix - I know only of three: my brother, my sister and myself. Having a Sri Lankan mother and an Australian father and living between both cultures has shaped my identity for as long as I can remember. Growing up in Australia, I hadn't always embraced the other half of my heritage. I understood that I was a member of two continents but struggled to gain a deeper insight into my identity wondering, ""am I Australian or am I Sri Lankan?"" Last summer, for the first time in six years, my family and I travelled to Sri Lanka to celebrate my uncle's wedding. As we stepped off the plane, along with that characteristic tropical humidity, distant memories slowly began to wash over me. I felt comfortable. I felt at home. The next day my brother and I, left alone for the morning, decided to explore Colombo. The streets were a sensory overload - traffic in every direction and a symphony of car horns painted a myriad of exotic colours. As we marveled at the scenery, my brother and I heard a faint voice behind us. Turning around, we saw a small man approaching and talking excitedly about a ""special festival"" in the city. We chatted politely and, after explaining that we already had plans, proceeded to walk away. But the man wouldn't let up, and as we quickened our pace, he quickened his. Suddenly, he hailed a rickshaw and said ""It'll be fastest if you take one of these,"" practically shoving us inside and then climbing in himself. He spoke to the driver in Sinhala, and before I could even comprehend what had happened, the rickshaw was moving. After collecting my thoughts, I asked how far it was to the festival. ""Just around this corner,"" he replied. We turned the corner and, sure enough, no festival - just an empty street. I asked the driver to pull over. No response. I turned to the driver and demanded that he pull over. This time he responded: ""3000 rupees."" I told him that I knew the standard amount was 200 rupees, and he simply said, ""3 passengers 3000 rupees."" I offered him 200 and attempted to exit. The stranger yelled, ""Give him the money,"" grabbing my shirt to stop me. I shoved him, held onto my brother's arm and ran. At that moment, an unfamiliar but clear feeling rushed over me: a sense of betrayal. I was a stranger in my own country. For the first time, I had felt distinctly un-Sri Lankan. I knew my physical appearance had always distinguished me from locals, but I had never let that diminish my own Sri Lankan cultural values and sense of belonging. Though, from these values I had manifested a false cultural identity. This particular experience was a rude awakening that made clear to me my own delusions and led me to reevaluate my own sense of self. Over the next two weeks, as my family toured around Sri Lanka, I endeavored to immerse myself in all aspects of local life. Eventually came the day of my uncle's wedding. The traditional Sri Lankan wedding represented more than just bringing individuals together. In my mind, it was symbolic of my own newly understood identity. In particular, seeing family come together from across the globe made clear to me the true meaning of my Sri Lankan heritage and gave me a renewed appreciation for how my background, experiences and unique cultural identity have shaped who I am today - someone who knows what it is to live in and between two cultures. It is this understanding that I believe will be especially valuable as I interact with students from around the world, and I look forward not only to sharing my own learning but also to learning a great deal from others."
"The entirety of the college experience. That is definitely what I am looking forward to most. Living in the same city for the past 18 years, I'm ready to start a new chapter in my life. I'm excited to make lifelong friends and, learn from their unique experiences in the same way I hope they learn from mine. I look forward to expanding my cultural horizons by exploring new cities, and look forward to all the memories that'll be created along the way. I'm ready to throw myself into a new school by joining new clubs and supporting sports teams. Finally, to experience living in a dorm with a roommate, is something I have always dreamed of. All in all, there is not a singular part of my college experience that I am looking to most; rather it's the whole thing that thrills me."
"What motivates me to learn is my endeavour to become the best version of myself. As Lebron James said ""Strive for greatness""; that is my motivation for learning. Just as with any other skill, you practice to become better, learning allows me to not only develop a greater knowledge of subjects but also to develop into a better person. This is because learning is not constricted solely to academics. By learning from other people and experiences, I can mature into a well-rounded person who is cooperative, empathetic along with many other traits."
"My 8th grade English teacher assigned spelling worksheets every week. I was of the opinion that they were far too mundane and did little to prepare us. After 2 years of getting straight A's in school, this homework seemed like a waste of time. And so began my 4 months of cheating on these worksheets. It was small at first, a question here and there and some persuading of my friend who I was copying from. But it gradually increased to the point that I didn't do any part of the homework; I just copied it all. Not once did my friend say no to my request. Sure it took some convincing and the occasional candy bribe but for the most part he was there to help. That being said, he always reprimanded me for copying, always reciting the old adage, ""Cheaters never win."" The call came Sunday morning, and my worst nightmare became a reality: My teacher had found out. My parents were furious and I was sick to my stomach. Monday rolled around and I had to stay after school. But an agonizing thought slowly formed in my head. My friend was going to be caught up in this mess too. I was hysterical; I begged her not to get him involved. I'd willing accept any sort of punishment she threw at me, but I couldn't let her ruin his school life because of my own hubris and stupidity. But no matter how much I begged, nothing changed. ""Rules are rules,"" I remember her saying. Lots of things changed that day. My outlook on school and homework changed; it wasn't another chore that needed to get done. It was something to be taken seriously and be done diligently. But what really changed were my relationships with the people around me. My parents had their confidence and trust in me shattered in a matter of seconds. It's surprising how long it takes to build and how little it takes to destroy. The same went for my teacher; she looked through every assignment that I submitted in case there was any chance of plagiarism or cheating. My friend, however, wouldn't even look my way for the longest time. I had betrayed him and his trust and ruined him on top of that. But things got better. It was hard, but they were willing to give me a second chance. My teacher had seen the worst in me and we had a much better connection than before. We spoke more often and she helped me change my attitude and demeanor towards school. My parents had their trust momentarily shattered but they believed in me and knew that I was capable of being better and we both tried to be closer so that these situations would never arise. But getting the forgiveness of my friend was the hardest. I apologized day in and day out because I knew it was my fault and I wanted to let him know that I had matured and accepted responsibility for my poor decisions. Fortunately for me, I eventually won him over. These days, even when I'm tired or feeling lazy, I don't skimp on my homework. I think back to the events of that day and force myself to be the person I know I'm capable of being. I've come to realize that there are no shortcuts that can replace the true value of hard work. While work may be tedious and tiring in the beginning, the end result is worth the struggle, a message that's helped me succeed in recent years."
"Since 9/11, radical Islamic extremists have become a larger threat as groups such as Al Qaeda and, more recently, ISIL lead more and more terrorist attacks against European nations like France and Germany. While the terrorist threat that ISIL poses is not brand new, one consequence of their existence is most alarming: the Syrian humanitarian crisis. Though ISIL will most likely fall out of the spotlight, violence in the Middle East will only continue until a cooperative international coalition can negotiate peace talks with the warring parties. However, our generation has been taught to speak our minds freely and to stick with our beliefs. In political issues we often doggedly pursue our own agenda rather than reach a middle ground, a trend seen both domestically and in foreign affairs. This leads to the inefficiency that worsened the refugee crisis and the violence in the Middle East."
"Curled up on the sofa, I watched as images flickered on the television screen. The Green Mile was on TNT and I began reminiscing about the film that sparked my love for movies. The shock I felt when I first saw John Coffey executed reminded me of cinema's ability to let us experience the life of another, whose background could be the antithesis of our own. Suddenly, we're presented with situations our own life may not provide and learn alongside these characters. I find myself confronted with inspiring new ideas and provocative questions, such as the morality of ending an innocent life, that stick with me long after the credits stop rolling. As I refocused my attention to the screen, I could feel tears welling up again as Coffey, the innocent soul who cannot survive in our cruel world, asks not to be put in the dark before he dies."
"An accomplishment of mine that I believe marked my transition from childhood to adulthood would be acquiring my first part-time job as a cashier. While finally going to high school could have been one of my chosen events that marked my transition from childhood to adulthood, I feel that getting a new job was a more dramatic change. As a kid in the elementary school, changes went from simple things like making friends and having good grades to higher responsibilities that did not necessarily mimic the changes from going from middle school to high school. I feel this event is a significant example of my transition because again my cashier job gave me new responsibilities I never truly had before as a child. Currently as a young adult, my responsibilities are doubled and much more complex. I was in charge of tasks such as arriving to work on time, remembering to clock in, and giving 100 percent effort at the job. I have to make sure that I complete my work in a satisfactory manner to keep my employer and my customers happy. If I were to face the same responsibilities perhaps two years ago, then I am sure I would not have been able to continue doing so due to the fact I was not as mature then, and I had no insight on the responsibilities that adults had to face. Two years ago my responsibilities were very basic and less complex than they are now. I am very matured now in able to define scopes and responsibilities as they pertain to my job."
"My favorite fiction work is the Inkheart trilogy by Cornelia Funke. I love the books because I like the concept of the plot, where a person has the ability to read characters or objects out of a book at will. I also love the book series because they were the first interesting books I read for my English class in 6th grade. The book series really got me into reading books more often."
"What motivates me to learn is my desire to excel in life and be able to pursue a good career in the near future. I hope that one day I can become a doctor or surgeon, so I need to be able to learn and complete my work on time. What also motivates me to learn is my want to obtain more knowledge. I find being able to discover new information to be fun, even if it is something that seems insignificant."
"My transition story starts with my recollection of the past, ""do this, don't do that ,come hear go there"", these where the words common to my at an early stage in life and yet they stock not until recently well the event that marked my transition from child hood to adulthood is one that cannot be holistically considered as pleasant at the least. Well as a child I was often kept under the guidance of an elder"" adult "" but as the days went by I stylishly began to assert independence to , never the less my transition was a sudden one. The event that marked my transition occurred days after I had just finished my waec well I saw the signs during a visit from my dad at school (I was a boarding school student).days after I got home I was informed that my dad had to undergo two surgeries for him to regain his perfect state health this came as a shock to me because I knew my dad to be a strong and healthy man; as the day for the operation reached we were all advised to remove all negative thought from our minds cause pessimism brings about negative result while optimism brings the reverse the operation was carried out on a Monday morning , it started at 6 am and during the period of his operation we were not allowed into the hospital due t o the fact that it was their policy. After the operation we were allowed in hmmm that's to say he survived. The week of my Dads operation was the same week I had an exam a state which was five hours away by road, normally whenever I had such exams I am accompanied by my mom or dad but this time it was different due to the situation at home I was asked to go alone wow this was a bold step. Many thoughts ran through my mind at that period one of which was that I should miss the exams but thinking about what my parents had sacrificed and also the money they had spent for me to write that examination strengthened my determination, after all the lamentation I embarked on the journey and to God be the glory It was a success. From that day forward I was charged with greater responsibilities and have since traveled to places alone without supervision. Strange as it may be it was my dad's operation that marked my transition from childhood to adulthood."
"Many universities teach, but Emory builds students holistically. For a university whose vision statement calls on community members to work collaboratively to achieve positive change -Volunteer Emory staff members facilitate weekly service trips to local schools, parks, and nonprofits as the core service initiative- I must say, I yarn to be part of such a community that holds onto values similar to mine. I engage in community services; weekly sanitation, visitation of secondary schools and the most significant the visitation of the sick, at hospitals, I have also co-headed seminars as the president of two volunteer religious organizations. As a strategy for the fostering of unity and the spirit of holidays, I initiated the periodic gift exchange between students, during the festive periods, which has helped a lot of students who don't normally celebrate get into the spirit of the season."
"I am motivated be many factors, one of which is the fact that, -I am the first son of my parent and would be the first male graduate in my family-. Nevertheless I am driven by ""A Dream"". Yes, I have a dream, not one similar to Martin Luther king's but of utmost important to the world. In my 12th grade I entered a competition which was solely about creating a sustainable environment, pondering on the topic my mind fled to recycling of waste, well after hours of pondering I came up with the idea of recycling waste jewelry and through the applications of some principle in physic and chemistry, I made a ""portable and affordable solar powered electroplater"" which was able to make worn out jewelries look brand new. The idea that, I need to read more to know more, encourages me to study harder toward actualizing my dreams."
"As I graduated a semester early from high school, I spent two months in a small village called Bayahibe in Dominican Republic on a PADI Scuba Diving Divemaster internship. When I look back my time on this beautiful Caribbean island, the first image that emerges is the weatherworn face of Punal. The only Dominican working at the center, Punal was a boat driver who often sat silently in an out-of-the-way corner by himself. The fact that he only spoke Spanish did not help his solidarity in our bustling diving center. English was the dominant language at the center whose owner, staff and clients were predominantly North American or European who almost always spoke in English. As the only Asian in the entire village, I felt a certain affinity with him. Despite my limited Spanish skill, we became good buddies. I once asked him how he drove a diving boat for so long and never went scuba diving. He replied, ""Only possible in my dreams."" One-day diving trip would cost him $120, which was tantamount to his one month's pay. He could never afford such, much less become a higher-paying diving instructor that costs thousands of dollars. Still, he felt lucky to have his job as many locals would fight for it. His revelation really opened my eyes to the harsh reality of Bayahibe, often veiled by crystal-clear blue water and beautiful oceanfront luxury resorts. Many of these all-inclusive resorts were located in a secluded area, tucked away from Bayahibe village into which their guests seldom ventured. Still, with tourism blossomed several restaurants, tour agencies and small shops on the main street of Bayahibe. Almost all of them were owned by foreigners with few well-paid jobs also taken up by English-speaking foreigners. Inevitably, local Dominicans competed for menial jobs, begrudgingly accepting the staggeringly low wages. As I was living in Bayahibe, abstract ideas of poverty became a more tangible reality. Hot water was a luxury to me. After a hard day's work at the diving shop, I grunted for having to shower with cold water. When it rained, it poured hard in Dominican Republic. Streets flooded within minutes of raining for the want of adequate sewage system. Piles of garbage bags, usually put out anywhere on the street, were rummaged by street dogs. Guagua-small battered vans filled to the brink with people-was the closest thing to a public transportation. Internet was only available in a few places. Ludicrously slow one, that is. Dominican Republic is one of the world's top tourism destinations, its natural beauty attracting millions of tourists. But how can its bare reality be so far from its cover picture? Is it because it opened its door to foreign investment too wide and too early? I couldn't help but wonder. I thought a foreign investment in a poor country was a good thing for its economy that will create jobs and tax revenues. But is it, really? What if the wealth created by it does not trickle down but only worsens inequality? My heart was heavy with endless questions. True, I've seen the condition of poverty in the Malaysian refugee camp and in the lepers' village in a remote Korean island. But my time in Bayahibe made a difference between awareness and mindfulness. I felt incredibly grateful for the opportunities and comforts that I took for granted. I was more conscious of my own thoughtless, wasteful behaviors. I started to sponsor a seven-year-old boy named Angel in Dominican Republic through a NGO. Also, I created a small non-profit website to help elderly local farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers. Surely, poverty is a complex issue, and small changes in me are not in the least an answer to my endless questions. But it's a start. I have come to believe that, whether personal or societal, a change begins with being mindful of the world I live in."
"Our planet is imbued with mankind's recklessness and greed, marked by unprecedented levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, deforestation, and pollution. Humans are degrading the environment at a rate no longer sustainable. Human encroachment and habitat destruction reach our ocean, too. I have seen coral reefs washed out of their colors, dying slowly. Unseemly human debris like plastic bottles and fishing lines is littered over the seabed. Some species of fish are overfished to extinction. Each year, over 100 millions of sharks are killed for their fins to satisfy our palate for shark fin soup. To me, an important challenge facing our generation in the next 50 years is to shift our perspective from narrow human-centered to broader life-centered so that we could be kinder to one another, to be compassionate to the greater community of life, and to preserve and cherish the environment within which we all live."
"My favorite film is No Impact Man: The Documentary which follows a Manhattan family's one year-long experiment to abandon their high consumption lifestyle and to make zero environmental impact. This movie triggered me to examine myriads of choices I make daily unconsciously that might have been detrimental to our environment. When we are more environmentally conscious, opportunities to make a change are around us. This summer when I heard that my grandparents will close their organic farm as they were losing more money than making it, I have spotted that opportunity. I launched a fair-trade website called Honest Farmers where consumers can directly place an order online. Without intermediaries, my grandparents now receive a fair price while consumers buy fresh produce at a good price knowing where it came from and who grew them. Now I know that 'going green' is a way to a more fulfilling, meaningful life."
"Jogging through my neighborhood on a mundane school day, I encountered it once again, the ruthless societal entity that endeavored to dim my otherwise bright day in St. Maarten. Veiled in the midst of joyous tourists, crashing waves, and beaming sun rays, the sincere nature of this notorious giant remained masked from the general public, nearly assimilated into the Caribbean island. It was an encapsulation of the government's inadequacy, irresponsibility, and insensitivity. It was an exemplification of the lax, and somewhat lethal, Caribbean atmosphere. Piercing through my inner core and demanding an immediate elixir, this ""it"" was the legal drinking age of sixteen years on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten: a societal phenomenon that injected a thirst for reform into one individual, me. Drowned in the midst of underage drinking and drunken brawls, my mind shifted to capturing this moment, the awe-inspiring juxtaposition at hand. The tainted societal nature of a low legal drinking age defiled the natural serenity of the Caribbean atmosphere while silently rupturing my interior, almost puncturing my morale. As I dawned nearer to my house, an innate sense of drive blossomed to life. Like a cancerous condition coursing through a human body, St. Maarten's legal drinking age of sixteen relentlessly pierced through the island, igniting crimes, stirring insecurity, and inciting murders. The roaring call for reform intensified in the island's sole newspaper, pleading for someone to generate innovative solutions. It was at this moment when I transformed into Neal Dow, but instead of seeking prohibition in the United States during the 1830s, I was instead motivated to revolutionize the realm of alcohol drinking in St. Maarten. As the island's regulations and governance remained lax by international standards, my internal sense of responsibility to increase the island's drinking age to eighteen years sprouted to the surface, ingrained in my Alpha Leo Club presidency and rooted in my qualities of discipline, determination, and commitment. It was time to channel the passionate drive for reform inside me into noteworthy change on St. Maarten. Remaining immune to the relentless forces of teenage fury and inevitable skepticism, I began my quest for reform at the grassroots level, namely with the act of disseminating educational information throughout the island. As an individual resolutely determined to highlight the island's unfortunate plight, as a result of its low legal drinking age, I promulgated the creation of a survey, as carefully formulated by the local Leo and Lions Clubs. What ensued was a shocking revelation that added fuel to my reform-minded drive to bring about meaningful change to the island; an astounding seven in ten teenagers had asserted that the task of obtaining alcoholic beverages was an ""easy one"". My movement's pervasion into the realm of public life was looming. In collaboration with the leadership of the Lions Club, I spearheaded numerous discussions with the local government and steadfastly advocated, in favor of a higher legal drinking age. A cost-benefit analysis of such a massive campaign's employment in a small Caribbean island sprang to life while data, including statistics and anecdotal evidence, exemplified the benefits that could be reaped from the passage of a constitutional amendment. Following a year of extensive research, conspicuous cooperation with the government, and the introduction of 'awareness campaigns' to the island's numerous schools, my thirst for reform was quenched, my hunger for change satiated. A constitutional amendment had been passed by Parliament. Having reached the apex of this ceaseless drive for reform, I pondered upon the pristine beaches, rustling coconut trees, and bustling one-way streets of St. Maarten, a natural beauty now liberated from its originally sullied social reputation. A once tainted amalgam of diverse cultures, awe-inspiring landscapes, and uneducated teenagers gradually transformed into one exuding with potential: a transformation attributable to the ceaseless crusade for legal reform. Though a fleeting individual in the island's memory, I am an indelible feature of St. Maarten, the springboard for my success."
"A dynamic fusion of the elements of a suburban campus with an urban center constitutes my ideal college campus, one that serves as the frontier between burgeoning opportunity and inquisitive learning. An oasis, preserving the features of a vibrant Southern campus in the midst of bustling city life, encapsulates the ""perfect"" collegiate environment. Infused with a tight-knit classroom setting and state-of-the-art research facilities, a desirable academic milieu dominates in the realm of data analysis while preserving an internationally driven and tradition-laden foundation. From an undergraduate student perspective, I hope to engage in ground-breaking research and furthermore serve as a link between the local and international communities. Apart from satisfying my unquenchable thirst for knowledge, I desire to gain access to noteworthy internships and cherish a unique balance between a Southern ambience and a lively urban center. The wise heart seeks knowledge, and at my ideal university, that is always possible."
"A sense of intrinsic motivation, infused with a steadfast determination to apply in-class concepts to the real world, serves as the predominant driving force behind my motivation to learn. To some individuals, titration is merely a means of determining an unknown solution's concentration while parabolas represent nothing more than the ""U shapes"" in a mathematics textbook. However, from my personal vantage point, these elements harmoniously fuse with one another. My real-life experience in the realm of testing samples in a local laboratory proved to be an awe-inspiring moment. Similarly, my application of calculus in the analyzation of a roof's curvature led me to understand what being an architect truly encapsulates. The capacity for this intellect to transform into pivotal advancements in modern society resonates deeply within me and thus fuels my desire to learn."
"I am a first generation immigrant with parents from two opposite sides of the world. My mother is Filipino and my father is Haitian. My parents, siblings, and I are not one person. We're different people shaped by our own definitions of ancestry, ethnicity, and home. We are different shades of brown and yellow, with different hair textures and porosity levels, and different religious beliefs. So when you ask someone like me who I am, it's hard to say the least. I am multicultural, multilingual, multifaceted, and, at times, multi-confused. But most importantly I am proud to say that I love who and why I am, especially because of the people that make me who I am. The diversity and history of my own family makes me feel a lot closer to people I don't know. I love people, I love working with people, and I love helping people. I am truly excited to continue to expand my community once I get to college. I can't wait to meet the different people of the world and to hear how life has touched them. I can't wait to watch my friends and peers become their best. I can't wait to become my best. College is the time for maturing individuals to shape and mold their talents and interests into reality. It's the time for rising adolescents to shape their futures and listen to their destinies. As a future college student, I don't want an easy load. I want to learn everything that matters to me the most well and to my best ability so I can be an asset to the world. At the age of 15, a junior in high school at Carver Early College, I marched confidently into my first class at Georgia State University. It's tough being in highschool and college. Still, I went home Christmas Break with all A's. Georgia State has offered me the opportunity and experience that few colleges in the city of Atlanta is willing to give me as a High School Student. My academic track, beginning with my freshman year of high-school, prepared me to be able to take my first college classes at the beginning of my junior year. Most of my graduation requirement classes were completed during my freshman and sophomore years, and so far, none of the credits that I have earned at Georgia State have been used to fulfill my high-school graduation requirements. It is all such a blessing, especially as young first generation immigrant girl. This experience has made me really appreciate the hard work my parents have achieved throughout their lives. Dual Enrollment has really helped me understand how to balance a fruitful college career along with everyday responsibilities. As a college student, I have been given the chance to delve more into subjects that I am passionate for such as foreign languages. The Spring Semester of 2016 I was able to sit in my first college level French class (French 1001). This past Fall I am complete French 1002, and this semester I will take my first advanced level class, French 2001 and my first Arabic class, Arabic 1001. It all still feels surreal, but I know that one day I really will be able to work and study with people from all over the world. I can't wait to share my love love for people. As an aspiring OB/GYN I am excited to finish my medical studies and work around the world with people from all around the world for people all around the world. People's lives matter and I want to meet them where they are. I don't want to limit my work to my comfort or circumstance. I don't want to only cure people, but I want to leave them lasting hope."
"Books are a child's best friend. I was the kid who broke the curfew rules just to finish a good book. One of the books I often stayed up reading was from Ally Carter's Gallagher Girl Series. It would be really nice to meet Cameron, the main character. She is fearless, swift, and fabulous. More importantly she is a young woman who is somewhat like me. She is reserved, simple, and inquisitive. It's easy to want something you don't have, but it's even harder giving up what you do have no matter how bad you have it. As a young woman who has faced death on multiple occasions, I really wonder if Cameron would trade her end of the spectrum for something that she has never experienced, but believes may be better. Would she choose a life of fun, money, and normalcy over her sometimes unfortunate life?"
"Perseverance looks like 4:00 A.M. zombie eyes tackling an endless stretch of work. Perseverance is staying in the college library on a school nights until 9 o'clock at night. Perseverance is sacrificing leisure for legacy. Perseverance is hard, but all I need to remember is that my future is in God's hands. God has placed key people in my life to play different roles; to help motivate me. Danica Peoples is a realtor who lives by perseverance. She's a friend, a daughter, mentor, and a mother. Since the very beginning of my high-school career, she's mentored and molded me into a great speaker and deliver. She has always seen me in the limelight and with guidance she introduced me to my confidence. I was hesitant at first,but just being around her more and more taught me confidence. People can make such a difference in our lives!"
"I remember when I first heard that I'd been nominated for the Posse Scholarship. I was beyond excited. I just knew that I was special because someone thought of me to nominate me. I thought to myself finally all of the hard work that I've been putting in has paid off. I went to my interview, and I saw many student that looked just like me. They were all intelligent looking and prestigious. I honestly lost confidence in the entire thing. But, I remembered a Posse prep meeting that was held at our school. One of the Posse Alumni graduated from my high school and he was giving us tips on our first round interview. He told us to never show weakness, always stay confident and that the spectators will be watching. They can see the weakness from a mile away. Once I thought about that, my confidence came back stronger. I kept a smile on my face and I introduced myself to everyone. They had us participate in various activities throughout the entire night. We stayed at the meeting place for about four hours. I was hungry, I was tired, and I was ready to go home. But, I didn't let that get in the way of my confidence and my impression on the other Posse alumni. I was on a mission that night. I was determined to make it to the second round interview. I made sure that in every activity I didn't try to be the boss so much because I knew that that was one of my biggest weaknesses. But, at the same time, I made myself stand out. I made sure I spoke with proper English and I spoke with intelligence. By the end of the meeting, I was glad it was over. But, I also had to get through the part when I find out if I made it to the second round or not. A week had passed and I start seeing different posts on social media from some of my friends stating that they'd made it to the second round. So I began asking, ""Well how do you know if you've made the cut?"" They told me that they received e-mails within the first week. So I began searching my e-mail and spam because I was sure that I'd made the cut. I didn't find anything. One day I did get an e-mail from Posse but it stated that they couldn't offer me a second round interview. I was so devastated because I was sure that I was going to make the cut. I kept wondering what did I do wrong, and how did those people make it above me. I talked to my mother and she told me that maybe Posse wasn't my calling and that it wasn't for me. There are plenty of other scholarships out there with my name on it. So I took those words and ran with it. I learned that everything isn't for me and that's it is okay to be sad for a while but just use that energy to work harder for the next time."
"In my opinion, the most important challenge facing my generation in the next 50 years would have to be replacing these non-renewable resources. Coal and crude oil are being used up daily and remember their non-renewable so once it's gone, there won't be any more for a long time. So an important challenge would have to be trying to find alternative energy sources so that people on this planet could continue living the way that we're living currently."
"My favorite fictional work has to be, ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"". I love that series because it is filled with so much suspense and mystery. Once you read the first line in the first book, you're hooked. You're basically following the adventures and paths of the Baudelaire orphans and how they overcome adversity. They do it successfully in each book, getting away from a dastardly villain that is after the enormous fortune that their parents left behind for them. I love horror films and horror stories, which is why I'm so attracted to that series."
"Each time we see an object we are capable of noticing something new about it. The artist who represents an object is critiqued by how they reproduce through drawing and painting their unique perception of the image. As Kandinsky said, ""There is no must in art because art is free"". Art has no limits; it's just like a function in math. Numbers that can be entered are infinite, therefore results that could come out of a function are illimitable. Painting allows me, on a single piece of paper, to express an unlimited variety of even my deepest thoughts. One day, my friends and I were looking for our teacher to have our daily conversation about what we would do later during our biology club. We knocked on the classroom door; a nimble hand peered through the slight opening and invited us in. A Japanese botanist had come to our school of four thousand boys to exhibit his studies on the morphology of flowers. He was showing the audience black and white pictures of flowers in different phases of development. As he was explaining each picture, he emphasized that every flower is unique and each flower's shape is heavily influenced by environmental factors when the flower is a bud. After school I headed to my Sumi-e class; Sumi-e is an East Asian type of painting featuring the same black ink as in calligraphy. My teacher told me that we would be starting a new subject: the lotus flower. I chose the appropriate paint brush, prepared some water for the suzuri (black stone to make ink) and started to create my flower on the blank rice paper. The lotus flower is depicted with rounded lines inside the petals that form them from the center to the tip, similar to a multitude of exponential and logarithmic curves arranged one next to the other. My painting was a failure at the beginning. The lines that I drew were too straight and haphazard. But then, suddenly, I remembered the pictures of flowers that I had seen earlier in the biology presentation. In my second attempt, my brain tried to associate the black ink with the concept of how a flower's shape develops. I set my brush at the center of the lotus and started to make a curved line, trying to imitate how a lotus' petal would grow and open. For that brief time, the brush-stroke carried all of my thoughts and ideas. Walking home that day, I passed a flower shop. A bouquet of white flowers caught my attention. If you saw them all together, it looked like a painting made by a great artist. Looking beyond, however, I found myself examining each individual flower, noticing that the beauty of each one was as unique as a fingerprint. The next Sumi-e class was about doing a composition of flowers. On my first attempt I felt satisfied, composing the bunch as graceful whole, but something made me feel uneasy. I had been focusing so much on the image of the bunch of flowers that my focus and appreciation for each one and its multiple variables had been blocked. As I started my third try, I closed my eyes, remembered the uniqueness of each flower that I had seen that day, ignored all other images that could corrupt my mind and drew each of the six flowers as if I was opening each one's budding petals with my own hands. In the end, stepping back, I could see that the bunch was a beautiful whole made up of thoughtful, intentional, single strokes. After completing this painting, I contemplated my own uniqueness within the groups that I am a part of. As an artist, I think about the multitude of thoughts, ideas and feelings that compose me. And I celebrate my ability to express them again and again in different combinations on a single sheet of paper."
"My favorite book is One Hundred Years of Solitude. It is about a family that lives in ""Macondo"", a small town isolated from the world. The main character leaves his name as a legacy to his lineage, until his last descendant, Aureliano, dies devoured by ants. The story is full of ambiguity and it's easy to lose track of it. However, by the end of the book, the whole picture emerges. The book relates the best and worst facets of human beings throughout history. One of the most meaningful events is when some companies decide to establish themselves in ""Macondo"". They make use of all available resources and leave the city devastated. This reminds me of the arrival of the Europeans to the native colonies in America. I love how the author ""Gabriel Garcia Marquez"" gives the reader so many elements to create a personal story."
"My ideal college would have a lot of diversity. I have lived in Chile my whole life and at the international church I attend, people from all over the world gather to share their experiences. It has made me feel more sympathetic towards new people. Another important thing would be for the college to have a good level of competitiveness. I am looking forward to have classmates that are outstanding at different things. I would compare myself to them and strengthen my abilities. Finally, my ideal college campus would have sports fields and travel experience. Sports are essential to me because they help me to stay healthy and they are also a great way to meet new people. As for travel, since I want to study environmental science, I would like to attend a college that provides resources to students interested in this area to complement their studies with nature."
"I blindly pat the bed to turn off my blaring alarm while trying to untangle myself from the bed sheets. It is 5:30 in the morning and I try to orient myself as I walk to the bathroom. It is pitch dark and silent. I tiptoe back to my room, trying not to wake up my sister who is sleeping on the bed above mine. After I wash and dress, I heat up my breakfast and check if all of my school supplies are in my bag. At 6: 40 sharp, I head out of my house and wait for the bus to come. When I arrive at school, I review some notes if I have a test that day or I go to tutorials for some classes. This has been my morning schedule for 3 years in my whole high school life. Ever since I was a little girl, I was always adamant about being neat and having everything organized. I hated being late to a scheduled meeting and the feeling of being unfinished. I'm glad that this personality of mine has carried on from middle school to high school. My punctuality to the morning schedule sets me apart from other students who don't take the bus every day. Those other students are able to come late because they have parents who can drop them off at school right before first period starts. In my situation, I am unable to miss the bus because my family only has one car and my dad cannot drop me off at the right time due to his schedule. Although this may be unfortunate, I'm actually glad about this situation because it pushes me to start my day rejuvenated with a review of some notes or even just a time of relaxation before the hectic day begins. Of course on Fridays, I feel so tired that I want to sleep in but I fight that urge and force my feet to walk me to the bus. I endure the fatigue and keep on fighting. On the other hand, people who come right before the bell rings are still trying to wake themselves up but end up falling asleep first period. Also, communicating with different people on the bus and in the hallways early in the morning helped me develop better social relationships. Last year, I took advantage of the free time that I had in the morning to attend tutorials from my AP Calculus AB teacher, Mrs. Sebe. Through these tutorials, I was able to sharpen my math skills and also develop my relationship with the teacher. In addition, I received and gave help to fellow students who were attending the tutorials as well. In the end, Mrs. Sebe's and my hard work paid off, when I got a 5 on the AP exam. Because I am familiar with approaching different people, I will be able to cultivate various connections in college or workplace. Having a good social skill is crucial in any kind of workplace because maintaining a healthy relationship repels any kind of misunderstanding or conflicts. All these positive consequences will fall into my hands just because I sacrificed my mornings to studious activities. Although fatigue and lethargy might seem like trifle challenges, these factors have already paved my future. My personality has turned into a habit of self-control and punctuality. A good habit is not achieved during adulthood but can only be firmly established if practiced from childhood. This habit of mine will follow me into adulthood and magnetize power, success, and respect. In my future workplace, I have no worries about fearing a scolding from my boss because of my late attendances or tiredness due to my inability to manage time. Although waking up early in the morning may seem like a non-important routine, I know that it is the gold key to opening the doors of successful future."
"The parable of the fox and hedgehog is the perfect epitome of our generation now and in the future. It tells of the kind of people that we are and questions the genuineness of the relationships that people have. More people are starting to become more like foxes, who are only concentrated on expanding the quantity, not the quality, or friendships. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, only have a few friends by their sides but realize the importance of having face to face conversations. The use of social media is only further exploiting the chances of authentic relationships at an alarming rate. My generation in the next 50 years will struggle to find the true meaning of friends after coming out of the covers of social media. More people like hedgehogs must overturn this unfortunate fate."
"If you go through my Youtube history, the most frequently watched videos you would see are vlogs about college freshmen moving into their dorms. Even the thought of living someplace new, after living in the same apartment for ten years, excites me tremendously. Because my dad has a job that does not allow him to have multiple vacations, we only have a week to enjoy vacation fully. When I go to college, the main task that I want to complete is to enjoy every vacation, not just summer vacation. Emory University is the perfect setting for me to fulfill all my wishes as a college student. It is only a short plane ride away from Disney World, where I've never been, and its location in the suburban gives access to small restaurants and malls to de-stress after a hard lecture."
"Writing this essay, I thought hard about which of the options to choose. I found that my background, identity, and interest seemed to bleed into one another. By background has shaped my identity, and my identity has had a huge impact in finding my interests. So instead of writing about one of these options, I instead decided to focus on how each has individually shaped the other. I've had a background not many other people in the world get to claim. Until moving to Phoenix, Arizona (for the 3rd time), I'd never stayed at one school for more than a year and a half. This meant that I always had the opportunity to make new friends and learn new things in the cities I lived in. One prime example of this can be found when I lived in a small town in Georgia, I got the chance to eat lunch with a homeless student one day. This student, named Tyler, told me all about how he'd moved to Georgia with his family a month ago, and it was taking them awhile to get on their feet. This reinforced my belief of not taking the things that I have for granted. Having this experience with Tyler has made me appreciate every opportunity that I've been given. Living in so many different places has offered me the chance to see so many different walks of life, and therefore learn so many lessons. My identity took it's sweet time exposing itself to me. For the longest, I felt that I had to shape who I was based on the people around me. It was a very long and uphill battle, and I took a lot of wrong turns before I found the right path. At age 13, meet ""People Pleaser"" Yakira. This version of myself had personality, trust me. It was just hidden under a pressing need to be accepted by others. This meant that I did anything in order to fit in with the people I thought were ""cool"". She ended up becoming a doormat for people that didn't care about her because she didn't understand the impact she could make if she believed in herself. Today, age 17 Yakira has gone through a lot of change and a lot of growth. The person I am today is the result of a lot of trial and error. I am surrounded by people that love and support me and I'm in a place mentally where I'm ready to take on the world around me. I've built relationships that will last me a lifetime and while it was a long time coming, happiness like this was well worth the wait. My interests have always been important to me, as I see them as an extension of my personality. I've always loved helping people and that has become obvious in my chosen career paths. One main interest that I have is becoming a Psychotherapist. The idea of helping people who struggle with mental illness really speaks out ot me because I have experience both helping peers that suffer and working through my own mental illness battles. It may be that small piece of ""People Pleaser"" left in me that makes me believe that everyone deserves to live a happy and healthy life, both physically AND mentally. My background, identity, and interest are so meaningful to me that I believe that without knowing them there would be no way for schools to know who I am as a person."
"My favorite types of TV shows, books, and movies happen to be psychological thrillers. These movies often involve a crime or mystery that needs to be solved and is more of a mental challenge than a physical one. I happen to like these movies because there is rarely a clean-cut or simple solution to a problem. The protagonist has to methodically unravel the case and basically work backwards in order to get the answers that they desire. I enjoy the way the protagonist often has to look back to previous events that seemed irrelevant at the time that they occurred. Another thing I love about psychological thrillers is the fact that there are never truly ""Happy Endings"", meaning that psychological thrillers often use more realistic situations for their conflicts as opposed to the Utopian worlds that most sitcoms take place in."
"My competitive edge is what mostly motivates me to learn. I've been told my entire life that I am my biggest competition, so I am always trying to better myself in the way of learning as much as I can. My motivation to learn springs from my motivation to be the best. While this mentality has both helped and harmed me, it has always encouraged me to learn that much more. It may also be my extreme level of curiosity that makes me want to learn everything about everything. There's so much in the world that has yet to be explored or examined, and I feel by learning and experiencing more, people my age are more compelled to go out into the world and discover. I feel like my competitive edge has had a positive impact on my motivation to learn, it's made my need to learn so much stronger."
"I was born in America to Chinese parents and I grew up in Macao, a city of Chinese origin but full of western culture. In middle school, everyone was in either one of two groups: The East and West. The Easts, or the Chinese locals, wore t-shirts with English words they couldn't understand, talked about boring Chinese dramas, and have never heard of David Bowie, which infuriated me. The Wests came from foreign countries, hung out after school at the park, where they sat on swings and talked about romantic relationships, and loved David Bowie. I found myself right to be in the middle, mingling with both sides because I felt an obligation to both my Chinese and American heritages, but despising the Easts and immersing myself in the Wests was a secretive pleasure I enjoyed. My parents made sure I studied to the best of my ability, and I obliged, bringing home great results on my report cards, but I never received rewards and instead every time a mere ""you can do better."" My constant exposure to Western movies like ""Rocky"" about hard work coming with rewards made me feel like my efforts were unappreciated, and to witness my dad drive six hours every weekend to visit my grandparents, the Chinese ""Filial Piety"" drew an even harsher contrast to my Western exposure, and made studying hard more than just a chore: it was an obligation to my parents. Despising the Easts eventually stopped pleasure me, and became a necessity. Just being around any Easts felt uneasy, which at this point included my parents. The tension got so high I tried to pretend I wasn't part of the family when we were out in public; I didn't want my friends to see me with any Eastern Association. Two cultures continued to battle a civil war inside me until high school, where I changed environments - started swimming in a new school of fish so to speak. There was no East nor West; the foreigners spoke terrible Chinese to the locals, and the locals spoke terrible English to the foreigners, but they always enjoyed each others' company. I started speaking a mix of English and Chinese at the same time, which caught on to my peers. Instead of dividing themselves with any sort of cultural constructs, my new classmates combined themselves into a culture of their own. It was at that moment I realized I was an individual who could bridge two opposing cultural values that existed both inside and outside of my mind. The cultural war inside came to an end. Due to the encouraging interaction between me and my classmates, the Chinese culture dominating at home and the Western culture dominating my interests began to intertwine, and the best way I knew to express these experiences was through writing. Writing has the power to clear up the obscurities of emotions, because, although the words of a single language cannot convey the entire spectrum of passions and tantrums, the combination of two languages came closer to making it possible. Where the language of English couldn't appease, the language of Chinese fulfilled. As I began to acknowledge the contributions that the Chinese language and culture offered, I embraced its values, in hopes to achieve much more fluidity in my duality. Although it would've boosted my personal development had I understood the advantages of cultural duality early on, I look back and appreciate every part of my journey. What's important isn't that my identify is now clearer, it's that my identity and the challenges that come with it is inescapable, and so having to face those challenges makes my experiences worthier and ultimately richer. I also understand that identity will be ever-evolving, always presenting more questions and obstacles. Such challenges and the overcoming of those challenges defines me as a distinguished individual."
"Last time I heard about artificial intelligence, a Stanford student created a chatbot called DoNotPay that has overturned more than 160,000 parking tickets. Serving as a lawyer robot, DoNotPay receives input from its users and creates appropriately legal documents to be mailed, ultimately successfully ""lawyering"" people out of parking tickets. The point here is, a robot is performing a job a lawyer does; who knows what kinds abilities robots will have in the next 50 years? With their efficiency and tirelessness, robots could potentially wipe out the need for hiring employees to perform tasks, which means that we could suffer a great wave of unemployment issues in the future. Nevertheless, this problem that may arise in the future serves as motivation for me to constantly refine myself, so that the robots' capabilities will always be no match for mine."
"High school has been an amazing experience for me, but now I'm looking to move on to a new environment where I can truly pursue my passions. My high school classmates have always done just enough to get by and never pushed themselves to achieve something they desired, which stifled my motivation to chase my passions. But I know that in Emory University, students pursue their passions with the strongest intensities, and I wish to be in such an environment where my peers' endeavors for achievement can in turn motivate and inspire me to do the same. I'm looking forward to finally joining a community where where I won't feel held back and instead feel encouraged to pursue my passions."
"I sat in anticipation, heart racing and palms sweating. Endless pressure to be intellectually perfect led up to this one, tantalizing moment. As freshmen, we were in our first year of public forum debate, so we worried that our arguments weren't as compelling as those from more experienced competitors. Suddenly, I heard ""winners,"" followed by a familiar name - my own. My head was spinning and my mouth dropped wide open in shock. Winning made all the work we'd put in, from yelling speeches with pens in our mouths to waking up at 5 A.M. on weekends for tournaments, retroactively even more inspiring. Everything happened in slow motion as we jumped up and down on stage in excitement. I felt at home celebrating with my supportive teammates. That first big win served as the gateway drug to my debate addiction. I became so invested in debate that I counted the weeks of the year in terms of weekends spent at debate. Because our team didn't have a coach, I watched myself step up to organize events to recruit members. As team captain, I moved out of my comfort zone to train the rookies; the most popular activity among them stressed quick thinking and professionalism. We all had funny words to slyly slip into normal conversations. I fell in love with our community and debate's beauty. Debate is more than just winning - it has allowed me to channel my interests and relate them to society. I explored angles I never considered on topics ranging from African American reparations to economic sanctions on Russia and genetically modified foods. While I prepared to defend both sides of these issues, my desire to learn more about their real-world implications continuously grew. I am free to generate my own conclusions about these issues based on my ideas. In a similar way, the skills I developed through debate are applicable to my other activities. The critical thinking from analyzing all perspectives applies when I'm planning scientific research experiments. The ability to adjust quickly - both mentally and physically - is also key in ping pong tournaments. In competitions like Science Fair, I find that the presentation skills learned from debate are useful. And in general, communication with others is crucial in every field. Thanks to debate, I have friends all over the nation from an array of backgrounds. I can learn from everyone I've met and experience cultures I never would have imagined. While thriving in this community, my partner and I still faced obstacles that would have made many others quit. Debate is like a science - you can plan everything perfectly, but the outcome isn't guaranteed. Despite all our efforts, we lost to arrogant competitors for trivial reasons, like the way we spoke or dressed. Looking to incite change, I realize that the debate world might allow for harmful biases, but it's also the vehicle to discuss solutions. I can speak about issues that affect me and numerous others through topics relating to discrimination and inherent prejudices. I've seen changes take place in considering the judging pool for tournaments and creating a safe place for everyone to voice their opinions to further education. These amazing debaters, who are some of my best friends, stand beside me in the fight for equality, creating the most supportive group I've contributed to. Looking back, I see that debate has played an integral role in my personal development. The knowledge and skills I learned through this activity have proven useful in everything I do, from research to table tennis. While debate has exposed me to some harmful prejudices, it has also equipped me with the tools to challenge these issues. Looking forward, I believe that debate has given me the potential to tackle any obstacles I might encounter throughout my college years and beyond. My dedication to debate is only the beginning of creating my own future."
"In today's world, the push to be the best has driven a trend of conformity. Be it fashion or ideas, many people are doing and thinking the same things as their neighbors. The unique aspects of students, including myself, are stifled under social media and peer pressure norms. Creativity is the lifeblood of the development of new technologies that promote human health and growth. As we're all acting in the same ways, no one is pushing the boundaries and changing what society considers to be normal. If we continue with this course over the next 50 years, innovation and the advancement of our society will cease to move forward."
"College is a time for exploration and personal growth. At Emory, I look forward to immersing myself in the culture and traditions, such as Wonderful Wednesdays, and broadening my personal outlook. In high school, I developed passions for business, science, and politics. Emory's curriculum that incorporates an array of various perspectives in each subject is the perfect opportunity to continue exploring these different topics. I'm excited to take classes like Ancient and Modern Science and Nazi Medicine and Biology to discover the link between science and other aspects of the world, including history and business. I look forward to learning with other students who are genuinely excited to explore and who are happy to be in the community. The support from students and faculty at a college campus, especially Emory, pushes me to delve into what intrigues me and also subjects that I have never learned about."
"I have never travelled alone. We were in my host dad, Speedy's, car, having just left our home for his father's home. My host brother Filipo, reading a comic book, sister Sara, fixated on her phone, mom Doriana, preparing to take a nap, and dad getting ready to blast his collection of American songs. This would be my first time experiencing a traditional Italian lunch. I couldn't be more afraid. I wanted the extended family to like me. After almost two months since my arrival in Viterbo, Italy, my knowledge of Italian was far from conversational and my tendency to be the quiet and shy kid was still present. Before I knew it, we were at the front door of my host grandfather's home. At that moment, I could feel my anxiety rise as my host dad banged on the door. This was the moment of truth. Would they like me or would I be in the midst of an awkward get together. ""Ciao!"" ""Che bella."" ""Benvenuta"" ""Buonasera"" All I could think to do was smile and wave. After a few moments, I decided to go around and introduce myself to each of the four strangers. I went and told them my name shakily. The introduction was awkward and I felt even more self- conscious about my Italian but I had done it. I realized, at that moment, I had been in this situation before. In fact, this is the exact situation I had been in with my own family. Coming from a family of Colombians and raised in Miami, Florida, I wasn't new to Spanish, but it was an insecurity of mine. When I was six, my family saved up enough money to take a trip to Colombia to spend Christmas with extended family. I remember my first meeting with cousins, grand aunts and uncles. An introduction much like what I had experienced at my first Italian lunch. I stood around the periphery of the group of people and with every comment that was sent in my direction I replied with a smile and a small wave before I gained enough confidence to introduce myself. In both situations I had felt awkward, out of place, and self- conscious, but what my six-year-old self would later realize is that this was my family and my lack of confidence and vocabulary in Spanish wouldn't change that. This same realization came during Sunday lunch. These people who I categorized as strangers were my family. They treated me just like my Italian siblings, with love and care. In Italy there is a saying: ""Cambiano i suonatori ma la musica e sempre quella"", translated as ""the musicians change, but the music remains the same"". I had arrived in Italy under the impression that I had travelled alone for the first time. I had been completely wrong. The people that I called my family may have changed, but we immediately fell into step with one another. Like the saying, I found that the music had remained the same. Growing up with my Spanish speaking family and later attending school abroad for a year, I learned to adapt and to be unafraid of new experiences. Both of my families taught me that by letting go of the small stuff, not expecting perfection, and facing the unexpected with confidence and optimism, I could be happy and successful in my future ventures."
"Overpopulation. Being one of the most urgent environmental issues, overpopulation is the main impetus behind the loss of habitats, global warming, the mass extinction of plants and animals, environmental pollution, and industrial agriculture. In approximately 50-100 years, at the current rate of population growth, we could reach the earth's human capacity which ranges between 9 billion to 10 billion. If my generation could regulate and decrease how the population consumes and interacts with its surroundings, we could prevent the worst outcomes predicted from a growing population."
"""There's nothing in the world that breeds success like success.""- Bob Ross. That is the quote that was instilled in everything I did from the start. Every challenge that forced me to push myself, every person who doubted my persistence fueled my drive to succeed because I knew with the reward of knowledge my future was brighter. My mother said, "" Do your best. Friendships come and go, but the knowledge you obtain will always be yours."" She wanted my focus to be on my education, to uphold and obtain a higher standard of education than the one she thought she had to settle for. And so began my drive to reach a level of success that would surpass my expectations to achieve for my mother and my family who had to sacrifice opportunities for our family."
"The first positive response to the sixty-seven e-mails I'd written to teachers across Istanbul came in the second week. I took a deep breath. The silence had made me nervous - pessimistic even - about the ability of my project to deliver sustainable help to Mustafa and those like him. I first met Mustafa, a 10 year-old Syrian boy, on a fall visit to the Esenyurt Primary School with my Interact Club. From the outside, Mustafa was the result of all the misfortunes in the world, a child refugee in a country where Syrians are facing increasingly hostile treatment. In broken Turkish, he told me that he was stuck in second grade instead of fifth because he did not speak Turkish fluently. His mother needed Mustafa to take her grocery shopping each day after school because she spoke even less Turkish than he did. She needed Mustafa to survive: to fill out forms, to translate conversations, to move around the city. He'd even written a few sentences in Turkish on a piece of paper so she could show people if she got lost. Mustafa was his mother's primary connection to the world. As I listened to him, I found it remarkable that I could relate to this total stranger in such a personal manner. My mother is my rock, my confidant, and my biggest cheerleader. She married at the age of 17 and because her energies were focused on raising a family, she did not pursue an education. Insatiably curious and lucky enough to cultivate my intellect through a top-notch education, I am often my mother's conduit to the larger world of history, politics, science, and art. ""I want to be an engineer and travel the world when I grow up - hopefully with a legitimate passport!"" joked Mustafa. As a child facing hardships every bit as huge as his dreams, if Mustafa did not question whether he could make a difference in this world, who was I to assume that I could not? I knew that the new coats we'd brought were not what Mustafa really needed. I realized it wasn't enough for me to be a loving daughter, stellar student, club president, or devoted friend. I now had a vital mission: to deliver sustainable help to those who most needed it. This help took the form of teaching Syrians Turkish, so that they could freely construct their futures and stop relying on the mercy of others. That night, I decided to create a platform through which refugees could learn Turkish for free. Three weeks later, fifteen teachers had answered my call, and in May 2016, after several months of coordinating, I was able to open my first class to the refugee population through a website called Volunteers United (http://www.syrianrefugee.education). Today, we have three active classes, and there are over a hundred Syrian women learning Turkish. 100 may seem like a modest number, but 100 mothers mean 100 families, and that means at least 300 people. The project was recently featured in Turkey's national newspaper, and I have been fielding calls from universities across Istanbul wishing to open a branch of the project on their own campuses. These mothers and their children have taught me that hope is something we should never lose. The twist is while my project was intended to help Syrian women and their families adapt to life in Turkey, I am also experiencing another Turkey. For the first time in my life, I am emerging from my comfortable bubble to engage with the most pressing challenges of our time. ""Our fingerprints don't fade from the lives we've touched,"" says screenwriter Will Fetters. In today's pessimistic culture, many believe that their efforts cannot make a difference. Yet now, as a firm realist, I know that an individual can make a change. And I aim to leave my unique mark on thousands of lives in the future."
"Though we are taught that wars start due to revolutionary ideas, desire for freedom or lust for passion, most of them have one underlying reason: hunger. It is generally believed that the ""Arab Spring"" was triggered because people were sick of oppressive governments but it was actually the despair of not being able to feed his family that led Mohammed Bouaziz to burn himself and thus initiate the first strike of rebellion. Even the civil war in Syria started due to hunger. The lack of water had prevented people from growing crops and created famine and unrest. As the primary need of humankind is food, its lack makes us forget our humanity. We become savages and start wars. Problems such as climate change affect our daily lives, shortening our life-span with increased temperatures and pollution. But it is hunger that will bring us to the edge of destruction."
"As a person who is afraid of oblivion, I am inspired to avoid my inevitable destiny of being forgotten by leaving my mark permanently on this world by bringing improvement to my environment. So, ironically, my biggest fear is my biggest motivation. I learn to grow, to be the best version of myself and to not be forgotten. A candle doesn't lose its light as it lights other candles; it only shares the light, brightening its surroundings. Like my surname Aydin (it means bright) indicates, I aim to enlighten my surroundings through education and leave my mark on people's lives. And that's why I learn. I want to learn so that I would have the potential to enlighten the people around me and make the world I am living in a better place for all of us."
"""Why would you want to study Chinese? You're white and from Maine,"" asked my temporary chess partner in Quincy Square. One single question, posed in a rude, ignorant way, managed to send my brain into an introspective spiral. I froze up and thought about the question. I had answered it superficially hundreds of times in my head. Chinese is the most spoken language in the world, its study will help me understand a different culture, and it will help my career in Engineering. These are all valid reasons to study Chinese, but not why I consider Chinese a passion of mine or why I decided to dedicate a significant portion of my life to its study. Chinese strikes a part of my heart that challenges always do. I am the type of individual who spends hours perfecting details that others overlook and see as insignificant, whether it be on the soccer field or on a math problem set. I love figuring out solutions to difficulties that at first seem impossible or overwhelming. Not only does the thrill of learning one of the world's most difficult languages satisfy my desire for challenge, but it also consistently introduces me to different sides of humanity. I love the feeling of being able to communicate with everyday people from across the world to discover our differences in culture. The summer after my junior year, after only one year of studying Mandarin, I was accepted into an immersion Chinese program. For three weeks, I went to Chinese camp, and then for the next six weeks I studied abroad in China. There were so many everyday experiences I had in China that made me passionate for its study. Specifically, one time while I was playing soccer in Harbin, a young Chinese student approached me and asked to join. We spent the following few hours playing soccer and teaching each other common soccer tricks from our home communities. After our little soccer exchange, I never saw him again, but I did have a lasting impression. The experiences and the relationships I made with the Chinese cemented my love for the language and prompted me to consider a gap year. While I still applied to colleges and universities that had Chinese and engineering (my other passion), my primary goal was a scholarship opportunity I considered to be a long shot: the NSLI-Y year long program in Beijing. My senior year was filled with disappointments as college rejections and wait lists became a harsh reality. I turned to Chinese to brace my bruised sense of worth and became even more hopeful that the yearlong Chinese program would accept me; but alas, my final disappointment came in the mail. I had been wait-listed. I was crushed as I felt there was almost no future in my Chinese studies. It was not until my passion was ripped away from me that I fully understood the truth to the saying ""you never fully appreciate something until it is gone."" After months of desperately searching for ways to continue studying Chinese at a university with no Chinese program, I received a letter informing me that the yearlong program had admitted me off the wait list. I accepted without hesitation. As I sit writing this from my dorm room at Beijing No. 80 High School, I could not be more fulfilled with my decision. I also can not forget the feeling I had when I thought I had lost Chinese. I am convinced that it is my passion for Chinese that eventually landed me here in Beijing, just as I am convinced that a continued passion in my interests will help me become successful. So yes, I may be a white kid from Maine who is interested in Chinese and Engineering, but I am also a student whose perseverance drives me to success."
"Protecting our environment during this economic and developmental boom is going to be my generation's greatest challenge. After living in Beijing for almost four months so far, I am uncomfortably familiar with hazardous pollution. This issue is not confined to China: natural environments in many Asian and African countries are also becoming severely contaminated. A massive island of trash floats in the middle of the Pacific, air in parts of India is rarely breathable, and clean drinking water is an increasingly rare commodity in many African countries. It is our generation's responsibility to pass a safe, sustainable environment on to our future generations. We are approaching the crucial crossroad between economic growth and environmental protection, a moment in which the earth cannot be forgotten. I aspire to play my part in fighting for the environment by developing technologies to clean polluted air and water."
"Learning has always been my favorite vacation. It gives me a chance to travel through the infinities of calculus equations, explore life through thought-provoking books, and dissect culture's complexities through studying Chinese. During high school I took widely varied courses, trying to visit as many places as possible before settling down. Along my journey, I ended up in Beijing, finding myself caught in the middle of an issue I know I will full heartedly combat for the rest of my life: pollution. I am deciding to set my roots in the mystical land of environmental engineering. There, I can build a fortress of knowledge and fight the evil forces of pollution. I expect to encounter many difficulties along the road; however, when I think of people with little or no access to clean air and water, I am inspired to persist and make a positive contribution to the world."
"As someone who had become accustomed to my small schools in Vicenza, Italy, I had never had a reason to feel isolated; almost every teen there were military brats and understood what each other were going through. Many of my peers were second-generation immigrants like myself and bilingual, and while less common, being lesbian was not incredibly taboo at my schools. However, in 2013, when I found out I am epileptic, I felt completely alone and separated from my peers. Despite this, my epilepsy has given me experiences that have shaped me as a person and my views. Quickly, I learned a new side to people, adolescents and adults alike. Some people act as if their research paper from ninth grade is more accurate than my doctor, which can be bothersome but I quickly learned to brush it off. At first, I would get frustrated with the people that made epilepsy jokes to me, especially when it was adults, but then I realized that the quickest solution is to shut the joke down and let them know why it is not funny. I even have begun doing this for all disability and illness jokes I hear. Most people ignore me, but the people that do listen are the ones that give me the patience to continue correcting people. The most difficult people to deal with are the ones that do not take my medical condition seriously, because I found that they are almost always adults. The concept of someone being bullied, especially for something they could not change, had always seemed like a foreign concept to me; who would do that? I learned the hard way from some teachers. In the middle of my sophomore year of high school, I was experiencing severe side effects from being overdosed on my medication for a long period of time. I could not handle being in any artificial lights, focusing in class was next to impossible, and staying awake for longer than a few hours was unimaginable. However, several of my teachers thought I was coming up with creative excuses to get out of work, despite that being completely out of my character. Although I am generally a confident person, I had never this from teachers, and who was I to tell them otherwise? I let it continue for a couple of months before it became too overwhelming and I asked my mother to come in. Eventually, I received recognition from my teachers and received a 504 plan so I could go to the special education teachers if I needed help when I could not focus. From that situation I learned two of my most valued lessons, which are the following: always stand up for yourself and that it is okay to accept help when you need it. Sometimes in life, we have things handed to us in life we do not want and you can either complain about it or learn. Being epileptic has not made me any less of a hard-worker and I have learned to stand-up not only for myself but for others as well, accept help when needed, and to have an increased amount of patience with others."
"An important challenge facing my generation in the next 50 years is sticking to the motivation to make a difference. Currently, my generation is active with Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration laws, and religious equality, however, a recent change in political dominance might cause discouragement. Also, there is the chance of people of my generation losing interest in these subjects as they get older. I think, even as technology and social media evolves, my generation needs to maintain the spirit that we currently have, for making positive social changes in the United States."
"Social and self awareness are what motivate me to learn. Frequently, I see people rejecting possibilities of truths they do not believe in, because they are not educated on whatever subject. Also, I was to help improve the lives of other by entering the medical field. I am familiar throughout my life with feeling like there was nothing I could do to solve a problem, being epileptic, latino, lesbian, and a military dependent. I know through education I can seek solutions to not only my problems but the problems of those around me."
"In my tenth-grade literacy class (terrifyingly known as ""Honors 10"" for freshmen and synonymous with Hell for those who partook), we read J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. We discussed the book thoroughly and, as I recall, many of my classmates detested the story specifically for the Holden's ""whiny"" nature or the overall thinness of the plot (or lack thereof). As any literacy class, we discussed themes of the book such as the loss of innocence, growing up, Holden's fight against these ideas, consequences of the publication, et cetera. I found the idea that to be ""grown up"" means to no longer be innocent intriguing. I will admit, at the time I felt mature; like I had had meaningful experiences and that I could virtually call myself an adult. I found my experiences ample enough to be an adult and handle responsibilities as such. It wasn't until this semester that I longed for those days of naivete. Suicide has always seemed like such a foreign topic. I want you to think about. Just think about watching the news and catching a report of another suicide... it's so far and abstract, is it not? And we try to be rational, emotional human beings and empathize with these events, but we cannot truly because we didn't know the person personally. We aren't directly affected. Of course, this is a perfectly natural human behavior and as guilty as we feel for not feeling anything we cannot blame ourselves. As a free-spirited seventeen year-old that was ready to crush senior year, go to college, and change the world, this is what suicide was to me-distant. As of August 2016, it was in my school and as of early November, it was literally feet away from me. I wish I could say I knew these two boys well. I wish I could reminisce on memorable moments where we laughed or did something stupid-but I can't. I was nothing but a bystander with expired connections with both. I mourn, but not like their close friends or family, but as a peer. As a teenager who could have been there; that could have saved them had I known. I mourn for the people that cry, that hate themselves, that cannot reconcile these events with reality. I mourn because of the sheer abstractness of it all. When I consider these events, John Donne's ""No Man is an Island"" echoes in the halls of my mind. Specifically: ""[a]ny man's death diminishes me, / [b]ecause I am involved in mankind,"" (line 11-12). Those lines are the only way I can rationalize my feelings on the subject and they give me some solace because I know that a man-albeit one who died over four-hundred years ago-felt something similar to me. I mentioned Holden at the beginning because for a time, I think I tried to hold back this motion off the ""cliff,"" perhaps I tried to be the ""catcher in the rye"" for myself. But being in such immediate proximity to a kid I used to play middle school football with, while they shot themselves, is bound to make that already weak ""cliff"" fall out from under. I feel these events have marked a line between my childhood and my adulthood because no child should see what I saw or feel what I feel. No high schooler should feel what those two boys felt-perhaps they weren't children anymore either. Before these, I saw the world as a fruitful place with potential for love and happiness, but not without flaws. This conception has been smothered. But it smolders still because to lose faith in the world is to lose all hope that it can be changed. No matter where I end up or what I do, I will strive to build a world where these boys could have lived and continue to have faith in the world."
"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is an epic journey, one in which the fate of humanity balances delicately in the thin walls of the ship Endeavor. Not only is the film a cinematographic masterpiece with horrifying and heart-wrenching scenes, but digital software allowed NASA's ""final mission"" to come to life. Nolan draws from a culmination of human literary and humanistic achievement drawing from elements of The Odyssey and Heart of Darkness. One crew member remarks that they will experience ""no evil"" because there are no men to perpetrate it. Ironically, they are thrown into a series of events reminiscent of both books in which they rescue a Kurtz-like character that nearly dooms the mission. The film masterfully displays the sharp contrasts between the darkest aspects of human action, and the potential for greatness through selfless and compassionate deeds."
"It is the interminable beauty and power of the natural world that drives me to learn. The thought that every past, present, and future event in the timeline of our universe could potentially be described by one, unifying field equation is simply mind-bending. It is our duty as members of humanity to ask questions and spend lifetimes answering them. On the surface, nature is so plainly simple and beautiful; the way the universe allows space and time to bend with mass, how all energy in most of Earth's ecosystems derive from the light of the sun, the movement and cycle are just so, utterly simple and natural. Its this simplicity that sparks my desire to delve ever deeper into the sciences."
"All eyes moving back and forth, up and down following my every move. Was I famous? Maybe they were staring because I was an ""alien.""In reality, I was just the new student trying to make my way across the classroom to introduce myself to the teacher.I was the center of attention. For me it wasn't just the first day at a new school it was life-changing. I had just moved from another country and I didn't understand or speak their language. I had mixed feelings, I was frightened, and discouraged but also kind of glad that my life would be different growing up here in Georgia. I thought I was in the land of opportunities that guaranteed and granted education. Instead, I was given an opportunity at a price; it has come with obstacles and barriers along the way. Through the barriers in my life, I have matured quicker than any other student. During my childhood, I didn't have to worry about anything but just about playing and having fun, little did I know stepping into that classroom everything was about to change. My family was already relying on me to pick-up the language and the knowledge that every other kid had years to learn. Coming from a country with a low standard of education, I barely knew how to read or write. I was intimidated by the level of knowledge the other students had. I would come home from school with homework that I didn't understand.The worst part was that I couldn't seek the help of my parents because they were new to this country as well. The only thing they could do was advise me by saying ""you will eventually understand it, don't give up, just keep trying."" As a kid, I would ignore them and just go on with my day because their advice were just words. Their words were meaningless because I was the one that had to face everyone. Eventually, I learned that I had to suck-it-up and teach myself for my family's sake and mine. I became more and more independent. As I picked up the language well enough and became familiar with it I started to appreciate all the advice my parents were giving me. I soon became my parent's right hand and more or less the backbone of the family. I started translating for them, filling out paperwork, babysitting and tutoring my younger sibling and cousins. Being the oldest in my family meant that I was automatically chosen to be the translator. Translating for my parents and my relatives became a big component in my life. It first started by just asking simple questions at stores and it later transformed into translating in more complex scenarios such as doctor's appointments. When my little sister was hospitalized my parents heavily depended on me to be there and translate because there weren't many bilingual staff members available. It made me realize that my hard work and determination to learn English has made an impact in my family's lives. All the responsibilities my parents gave made me blossom into a mature and independent person. Learning English and knowing that I was helping my parents so much gave me the confidence to keep on excelling and soon I became passionate about school and achieving the impossible. As I became older I started to understand the American Dream. My American Dream means that with hard work and dedication doors open, and more opportunities are left to choose from. My experiences with translating at doctor's appointments have made me realize that I want to pursue a career in the medical field, in order to help families that weren't as fortunate as my family was that had a translator. I know that there are still lingering obstacles in my path that are preventing me from reaching success, but I know I am more than capable of overcoming them."
"The world is constantly changing, time keeps moving forward whether we like it or not, new inventions are being made and technology keeps on enhancing our lives for the better but also for the worst. The human population keeps on escalating but is technology affecting a face-to-face human interaction. If it's slowly affecting us now it's certainly going to be a challenge that my generation will face in the next 50 years. No matter if it's a phone call, text message, DM, email or a tweet I've become a person that likes to have a conversation face-to-face. Face to face conversations is slowly fading away. Two people can be right next to each and lose their concentration spam because of their technology."
"The thing I'm most excited about going to college is the freedom I'll be receiving once I start. When I was in high school I thought I had an abundant amount of choices that I could choose from but I realized that they were reserved for a specific grade level. As a freshman, I always wanted to be with the people I knew because I was in my comfort zone but later on I started to become more and more distant from them and started focusing on what I wanted. I soon began to meet new people and started learning new things. I became a curious person and I soon started to adapt to an environment quickly. I'm excited about meeting and interacting with new people and learning new things."
"Growing up, I always believed that I was just an accident, an error, and a burnt cookie. I used to believe that I was an outsider, a foreigner, and an alien, only because I was not like the other kids in school. Only because I looked around me every single day, and saw that I was not like the kids around me. I was an afakasi, and a multiracial outcast. I distinctly remember having trouble to fit in, and having a hard time trying to make new friends, as cliche as that sounds. While everyone had light brown skin with dark Samoan hair, I was dark skinned with dark thick kinky hair. This was my normal, always the last to get picked to play on teams and games, and was constantly getting picked on. Nonetheless, I was blessed to have been raised in American Samoa, where the culture and language was a part of me and was stuck on my like a second skin. In addition, speaking fluently in Samoan and in English worked extremely well in my favor, academically and socially. My insecurities about my physical appearance further increased my shyness, which consequently led me to stay in the house and avoid going out to social events. My schedule consisted of school and church only, which was also one of the many things I was made fun of. However, none of the teasing and taunting bothered me, sure it got to me my head at times, but unlike those kids, I had priorities. I felt as if although I was different from the rest of the kids, that shouldn't be an excuse to hinder my studies and to be a setback in my academic success. I became a very independent individual, always doing my own thing and going out my own way to make sure I had good grades. Yes I was fluent in both English and Samoan, but that did not mean I understood the culture as much as people portrayed me to. I only understood a bit of the culture at the time and was often bored out of mind, which caused me to not pay attention and avoid attending cultural occasions. Now that I think about it, the only reason why I got bored was because I felt as if I was not an apart of these occasions and events, mainly because I never had the chance to learn it. Maybe if I 'd understood much more, then I would've enjoyed it at the time. I had a hard time choosing between English and Samoan, I felt like I was suppose to choose either one. I chose English of course, and set out to perfect it even more. However, my failure to fit in due to my ethnicities, only made me try harder. The urge and desire to prove everyone wrong was what ignited my successful academic journey. I wanted to show people that just because I was not like them physically, and was considered an outcast, I would rise up academically. Throughout this whole journey of finding myself, I realized that choosing between the two races, Samoan and African American, shouldn't be an option. I am obliged to accept both because it is what I am and it is how I came to be. So what if I was different? It only meant that I was unique, one of a kind and that I would stand out from the crowd. With this newly found confidence and acceptance, I started going all out there, by embracing my Samoan culture, along with speaking fluent in English. This gave me an advantage in my classes, because I was fluent in both languages, I caught up faster with the teachers lecture. I learned that I should learn to accept myself, and use my blessings, which are my two ethnicities, as an advantage."
"College experience is what every student entering college dreams of receiving, and every student has their own expectations. I look forward to the integrating of new ideas from different cultures, inside and outside of the classroom. The idea of these different cultures and backgrounds coming in together for the same reason, excites me. In addition, I believe that it will be interesting to observe how other people with backgrounds and cultures different from mine, handle things and act. Furthermore, where I come from we all have a mutual love for food . I have heard of a restaurant near the campus called ""Falafel King"", and that they are one of the best places to dine, simply because it will make you feel at home. This excites me because, now I have a place that will make me feel right at home everyday, especially after a long day of school."
"You may find this odd but the truth is, I believe that my heart motivates me to learn. I grew up around the phrase ""follow your heart"", and I will follow my heart indeed! Every decision I made, everything I did was based off of what my heart told me to do, and I have not regretted a single thing. So if my heart says to continue my education and to learn, why should I not? At times, my family and friends may say one thing, but my heart has it's own story, and it has been an ongoing conflict. My family wanted me to join the military mainly because they thought it was the best choice for me, but my heart said otherwise. Instead of listening to my family, I listened to my heart because I know that my heart knows what is best for me."
"In Aisle 13 under a sign reading ""feminine products,"" I stood embarrassed and disoriented by all the different types of pads and tampons. It was as if the whole world, or at least everyone in Target, was looking directly at me; I wanted to grab the closest item and run. I looked at my mother, who was distracting herself with the vitamin display, and tugged on her shirt, begging for any assistance. She gave me an exasperated look and pleaded, ""Just pick something and let's go."" This has been my experience with sex education: the topic is avoided until it is impossible to ignore, then dealt with in secret and never spoken of again. My mother diverted the subject whenever I brought it up. Anything related to sex was ""taboo."" In conservative Iranian theocracy, where she spent most of her life, women were always kept from power, even when it came to their own bodies. It was wrong, even illegal, for women to openly talk about sexual health; therefore, nobody ever did. My mother grew up with this mentality. Even though her mother was a doctor, the subject was disregarded in her home, for fear of breaking tradition and the established system. My mother shied away from talking about female health and, for the first few years after arriving in America, from going to the gynecologist. This negative view of sexual health was then passed along to me. I was never taught anything about menstruation, disease, or protection. Since she barely knew the answers herself, my mother could not answer my questions. Even in the liberal state of California, I was taught subpar information about reproduction and sexuality. The bleak classrooms with disinterested teachers and out-of-date textbooks gave inadequate information that was not relevant to contemporary life. My mother's secretive attitude discouraged me from asking questions of my teachers; if I could not consult my own family members, how could I approach a stranger? I began to believe anything related to sex was wrong. With no one to turn to, I kept my questions buried away. The summer when I was 16, my curiosity and confusion bubbled to the surface. My friends began to enter relationships, confronting sexuality head-on. I gathered that everyone was just as clueless as I was, with potentially disastrous consequences. Seeing the negative effects on my friends was a huge wake up call and I started to educate myself about the issues they were having. I did research on the internet and asked probing questions of my doctor. I became obsessed with making up for lost time by expanding my knowledge about sexual education, but there always seemed to be unanswered questions. I decided to help change this culture, beginning with my own school. I initiated a meeting with the ASB Health and Beautification Committee to discuss updating the sex education curriculum at our school. We collaboratively developed a student survey to gather opinions of the existing curriculum, as well as what was needed to make sex education more relevant. We then submitted the survey results to the district headquarters, elaborating on our efforts to reform the program... beginning with a change in our textbooks. This was the push my school and district needed to explore reform. Sex education should thrive; providing up to-date information and textbooks that are in sync with the 21st century, within a comfortable learning environment, is crucial. Sexual awareness is the principle power that each of us has over our body. This direct responsibility makes me aware of how I should remain informed and healthy. It is a right that I had not exercised completely until recently, and one I believe many others fail to effectively exercise. My hope is that in developing my own comfort in this subject, I can help normalize the subject among teens and parents, and ensure that sex health is embraced and explored, rather than avoided."
"Loft 4D consists of more than just a single phone charger and bad plumbing. Roommates change everything and for Jessica Day in New Girl, it shows. When Jess decides to move into a loft with three strangers, she meets people who influence her life for the better. New Girl values many things like cats and feeling sticks that I too find important, but mostly friendship. While New Girl makes me laugh until I cry, it also makes me reevaluate my own life and the people who I call friends. Even though I know my friends cannot go out and buy me a lionfish like in the show, I do know my friends will help me out when my car catches fire (like it did) and cheer when I sing in front of 2,000 students. Loft 4D is place for friendship, both in the show and in my own life."
"I motivate myself to explore everything because at the end of the day, it all relates back to me. Pieces of everyday life are subject to questioning until I go out to find the answers. How would I know if the chemicals in my cleanser are truly beneficial? I would not have known until I learned that the main ingredient, Persea gratissima, is actually only avocado oil. How would I know why my Persian father received hate in Oklahoma in 1979? American history taught me that that was the same year as the Iranian Hostage Crisis, creating hostility between Americans and Iranians. I want to familiarize myself with history, people, and cultures to help me become more aware of the world around me. My curiosities will never be quelled and I want to continue learning for as long as possible."
"Twenty-two. The number of countries I have travelled to. Since I was young, traveling has taken up the majority of my summers. Before I left behind my parents at the airport, they warned me saying, ""Remember. Keep yourself far away from the Iraqis because there is a large chance they are dangerous."" Once there, after a day of walking around for hours, our group grew weary and hungry. Upon seeing us, a lady waved to us and welcomed us into her home. As we walked in, she yelled to the other family members to come greet us and prepare a room for us to rest in while they prepared tea and dinner. Our language barrier prevented us from having a full conversation, but it did not stop us from feeling extremely welcomed. Although she gave us food and a place to stay, her true hospitality was making space in her home and life to care for several weary strangers. I hope to follow her example when I become a doctor. Rather than seeing my patients as issues I need to fix, I hope to make space for them in my clinic and treat them with respect and care. When I travelled to Guatemala, I was shocked to see how quickly the living conditions deteriorated as we travelled from Guatemala City to the village of Acatenango. We saw many closely-spaced structures with wooden post walls and roofs made of steel. I was saddened to find out that many were forced into these dangerous conditions by the growth that came with globalization. I was shocked that, in order to survive, the 75 year old senora I made a cookstove for needed to work in the coffee fields where she is exploited; because of the distance from the cities, there is no guarantee of proper pay or safe working conditions. I was furious that many developed countries emphasize the positive aspects of globalization without acknowledging negative impacts. Although my work was improving the poor conditions they lived in, I realized that much more needed to be done to combat the negative effects of globalization. As a doctor, I would set up clinics to provide basic care for the villagers, for whom the nearest clinic is a 90 minute drive. I would also support responsible global practices and work with the UN and World Bank to educate the next generation in countries like Guatemala to enable them to benefit their societies. This summer I traveled to the Dominican Republic with a few professional musicians to teach music. Eduardo, one of my students, was sixteen just like me and was the first friend I made in the DR. On the last day of the camp, I learned that Eduardo was almost sold into human trafficking by his family, to work in the US. After hearing Eduardo's situation, I no longer thought of trafficking as another country's issue, but as an issue that involves the US as well. I have been saving a part of the money I make from violin lessons to buy instruments to donate to the Dominican Republic. A viola that I donated has been given to a student in the Dominican Republic, and I hope to continue to do so to prevent more children from accepting unsafe jobs, such as prostitution or drug-dealing. I hope to continue contributing not only instruments but also medical supplies and basic necessities that could help improve their standards of living. During college, I would like to participate in Global Brigades, where I can work with people who are passionate about helping the underprivileged. I hope to continue traveling in the future so that I can gain more perspectives to help me find more possible solutions to address these global issues. One hundred and seventy-four. The number of countries I have yet to discover and make a positive impact on to truly become a global citizen."
"My ideal college campus emphasizes research and collaboration. Research would allow me to explore topics I am interested in. When finding solutions or ways to study an issue, researchers are required to start with the basics, ensuring a strong understanding of the topic. A strong understanding of the basics makes learning new but related topics much easier, which would be essential when learning numerous subjects in close detail in medical school. Studying at a university with a collaborative environment is perfect for me to improve upon my weaknesses and to reinforce my strengths. I would also be able to make deep friendships with fellow students who are passionate about all different types of subjects, challenge me to step back and develop a holistic approach to analyzing situations and learning new information. Emory's affiliation with the CDC and Georgia Tech for research and TEDxEmory are what make me excited to apply."
